	abstract = {New energy (NE) power generation technology has become an important means to solve the problems of global energy demand and environmental governance due to its sustainability and cleanliness. However, restricted by climate and other factors, the instability of its power generation capacity has a serious impact on the voltage multimedia quality evaluation of small microgrids, which even causes damage to important equipment. This paper proposed a multimedia quality evaluation method in the new energy power generation system relying on intelligent robot numerical control technology. According to the state characteristics of different units, the expanded representation models of conventional units, wind turbines, and photovoltaic units were established, respectively. Based on intelligent robot numerical control technology, a multimedia quality monitoring model of the new energy power generation system in random production simulation was established. The planned outage condition of the unit, which was ignored by the current stochastic simulation method, has been fully considered to ensure the rationality of the simulation of intelligent robot numerical control technology. The intelligent robot numerical control technology was used to explore the expected production power change of the unit and to improve the calculation speed and accuracy. In this paper, an appropriate wind and solar power generation model was constructed based on the output characteristics of wind and solar. Secondly, the influence of random faults between units on the subsequent loading rate was studied through probability calculation. The start-stop factors of conventional units were comprehensively analyzed. Then, the expected value of unit start-stop times was obtained. The average relative error of the expected value of the power shortage of the new energy electricity generation system (EGS) was 2.45%, and the error was lower than 2.98%. In the intelligent robot numerical control technology in this paper, the planned outage condition of the unit was considered, which showed the correctness and superiority of the multimedia quality evaluation of the proposed model.  © 2023 Ruijuan Sun and Xiaoyuan Dang.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a Hierarchical Blockchain-based electricity market framework is proposed for peer-to-peer energy transactions within and between Microgrids in a security-constrained cluster of Microgrids. This market enhances the energy transaction mechanism, market clearing process and security of the power market. The existing blockchain based electricity markets usually check the energy availability through a transaction verification process, however, the feasibility of energy transactions between microgrids from the power system point of view is not evaluated before approving a transaction and creating a new block. In this paper, the unique structure of the market makes it possible to consider reliability security constraints of the power grid during the transaction verification process. Furthermore, the blockchain ledger summarization and microgrid's equivalent model development are other new features of this framework. To develop and verity this market framework, Java programming language is used to create the hierarchical blockchain-based algorithm, and a modified IEEE 37-bus distribution test feeder system is chosen as the case study. Numerical results will show the effectiveness of this market structure, especially, when several transactions are requested to transfer energy over some congested transmission corridors. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Israel is located within the global solar belt, having high population density, a small share of rural population, while industry makes up a great part of the gross domestic product. As such, Israel is an excellent practice test site for identifying the best approaches to increase photovoltaic (PV) power penetration into the economies of developed countries. The core of the new distributed renewable power friendly paradigm is local prosumer-to-prosumer microgrids, which are aggregated into secondary supergrids, which may be, in turn, aggregated into ternary supergrids. Besides, the approach is also promising from the social point of view, transferring the power management to the people. The comment dwells into the challenges and possible solutions, which Israel is facing toward zero carbon energy production. Resolving these issues will affect the way of future sustainable energy supply growth and management. The comment written here refers also to the paradigm of battery technology for storing the PV energy, pointing on a possible misunderstanding within the battery community, which addresses the number of cycles a battery system can provide, rather than the expected service life of the system itself. In this aspect, it is proposed to focus the efforts of the researchers and developers into an alternative battery system. © 2022 The Authors. Energy Technology published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {The development of a suitable scheme for protection of DC microgrids is still a major challenge. This is due to the shortage of practical experience in appropriate protection guidelines and standards related to the uncertainty in the network topology, absence of a natural current zero-crossing point in DC systems, and dependence of fault current shape and magnitude on various factors. These factors include network topology, type of converters used in the network, type of fault and its location, fault impedance, and type of system grounding. In this paper, these factors and their impacts on the development of a comprehensive protection plan for DC microgrids have been investigated. Various algorithms that have been proposed in previous studies for fault detection and location are reviewed, and the technical challenges associated with the use of communication links in smart protection systems are described. In addition, the advent of new technologies for development of DC circuit breakers are reported, which are different from the conventional AC circuit breakers due to the differences between the faults in DC and AC microgrids and their respective clearance times. This comprehensive review covers all aspects of the DC microgrid protection including topology, converters, configurations, and types of faults. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The classic energy supply system is mainly based on the stabilising properties of electromechanical synchronous generators. The structural change of the electrical energy supply system towards a decentralised grid structure means that ancillary services must now also be provided at the distribution grid level. The Virtual Synchronous Machine (VISMA) was developed at the Institute of Electrical Power Engineering at the Clausthal University of Technology with the aim of making a decentralised generation unit in the grid behave like a real synchronous machine and thus actively provide relevant ancillary services. The VISMA is based on a three-phase inverter that can comply with grid requirements by adding an energy storage device in the DC link and using a special control algorithm. The focus of the investigations shown here is on the uninterrupted transition from grid-parallel operation of the VISMA to island grid operation and the subsequent stable continued operation of this island grid. A controller changeover, as most feed-in inverters would require in order to change the operating mode, is not necessary here. It is shown that the transients have subsided after 5 ms, which means that the VISMA has completely taken over the supply of the load, and the new steady state is reached after 40 ms. © 2023, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

	abstract = {Microgrid topologies enable more effective use of renewable resources as well as the autonomous process. Microgrids are effective frameworks for managing dispersed assets such as renewable structures with small-scale distributed generator supplies. Smart grids are adaptable electricity networks that have arisen as a result of the introduction of new technologies and features. It is suggested that a three-terminal AC/DC hybrid microgrid with DC two and AC one terminal be used. A two dual active bridge (DAB) with cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter with AC grid link-based interactions that connect isolated two DC buses are included in the suggested structure. To minimise the energy generation stages and power devices, the DAB converters are intrinsically linked to the CHB of DC rails based on the structurespecific requirements. To present the unnecessary grid currents and DC rail voltage issues exist by this revised structure topology by simply two power alteration stages, a better solution is suggested that employs zero-sequence voltage (ZSV) injection in the CHB converters. The impacts of managed settings on structure stability and dynamic responsiveness are investigated in order to reduce conflicts among ZSV injection by structure voltage/current regulation. This paper compares the performance of a PI and a PR for DC voltage regulation. A comparison of simulation results for both control approaches is provided. The major difficulty is to normalise the system model in order to identify the appropriate controller settings for robust control. The findings are confirmed and compared to the conventional regulator PI. The suggested 3-Φ AC current and DC rail voltage regulating approach's universal efficacy is proved by MATLAB/Simulink analytical model from the three and five-terminal hybrid AC/DC power structures © 2006-2023 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

	abstract = {The concept of the digital twin has been adopted as an important aspect in digital transformation of power systems. Although the notion of the digital twin is not new, its adoption into the energy sector has been recent and has targeted increased operational efficiency. This paper is focused on addressing an important gap in the research literature reviewing the state of the art in utilization of digital twin technology in microgrids, an important component of power systems. A microgrid is a local power network that acts as a dependable island within bigger regional and national electricity networks, providing power without interruption even when the main grid is down. Microgrids are essential components of smart cities that are both resilient and sustainable, providing smart cities the opportunity to develop sustainable energy delivery systems. Due to the complexity of design, development and maintenance of a microgrid, an efficient simulation model with ability to handle the complexity and spatio-temporal nature is important. The digital twin technologies have the potential to address the above-mentioned requirements, providing an exact virtual model of the physical entity of the power system. The paper reviews the application of digital twins in a microgrid at electrical points where the microgrid connects or disconnects from the main distribution grid, that is, points of common coupling. Furthermore, potential applications of the digital twin in microgrids for better control, security and resilient operation and challenges faced are also discussed. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the usage of new technologies in distributed generation is growing due to the electricity industry movement towards privatization and decentralized production of electric energy as well as competition among the new technologies. Microgrids are practical examples of the concept of decentralized production. Also, the employment of renewable energies is rapidly promoted due to the construction barriers of conventional power plants. Therefore, selecting and applying the appropriate technologies in planning and careful design of the type and capacity of generation and energy storage units are important. This paper proposed a robust model for day-ahead production scheduling of electrical and thermal units in a large-scale virtual power plant comprising a large number of distributed generation units and consumers accompanied by energy storage. To consider real conditions, the uncertainty of electrical demands is modeled by employing scenario-based analysis and probabilistic programming. So, five scenarios are created and modeled. In addition, two operation mode of a microgrid is considered connected and islanded modes. The objective function consists of total profit resulting from the daily operation of all units. The results confirm the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model. Moreover, the total profit of the connected mode of the microgrid is about 20% more than the islanded mode, in all scenarios, and the cumulative profit cash flow of the connected mode is about 31% more than islanded mode. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

To reduce the original problem to a tractable single-level one, a master-slave scheme is developed by which binary variables can be fixed and thus the inner problem can be reduced to its equivalent Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Then, the overall optimization paradigm is solved in an iterative fashion used the Constraint-and-Column Generation Algorithm. The resulting tool is applied to a benchmark isolated microgrid, thus validating it for industry applications. Moreover, different relevant results are analysed in-depth. Thus, the role of hydrogen storage and demand response initiatives is discussed, concluding that flexible demand has a more notable impact on monetary savings than hydrogen storage, reducing the total cost by 6 % with respect to the base case. Some intrinsic issues are also identified. For example, it is observed that flexible consumers are more frequently called when the hydrogen chain is enabled, which may provoke undesirable effects like response fatigue. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the local distribution grids have been facing technical, economic, and regulatory challenges, because of the increased integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and electrification of vehicles. The traditional solutions to the grid expansion, e.g., to build an additional power line, are utility-centered solutions, i.e., the distribution grid operators (DSOs) are the only party involved to tackle grid issues. The DSOs have to engage grid users with technology providers to develop innovative solutions that tackle one problem and overcome several cost-effectively. This paper presents a holistic solution to optimally control cross-sectoral energy flow between interconnected microgrids (MGs) consisting of different RESs, hydroelectric power plant (HPP) and wind turbines (WTs) to meet electric vehicles (EVs), residential, commercial and industrial demands with the main grid contribution. This issue will provide the advantages of community-based MGs for local energy trading which causes for an active and engaged system, however, an adequate control strategy for proper operation is required. The proposed solution is based on a new interconnection line between two MGs through a multiport converter (MPC) with the techno-economic consideration of newly installed components such as MPC, cables and the required battery energy storage system (BESS). The proposed case study is evaluated under three different conditions e.g., load increment, demand response (DR) and N-1 criterion in separate, interconnect and island modes. The CPLEX solver of GAMS software is employed to solve the mixed-integer linear programming model. The results show that the applied interconnection line for MGs compared to the separated operation mode can decrease the system's total costs, reduce the applied peak to the upstream grid, and enhance the system's reliability under different conditions. Furthermore, the applied solution provides the ability for MGs operation even in island mode under different conditions for a full day (24 h). © 2022},

	abstract = {Microgrids are a single entity that manages several distributed generators and linked networks. This is the most recent study field in which traditional and renewable technologies may be combined to address the difficulties of transmission losses and CO2 emissions. Making microgrids smarter and more efficient requires cost-effective scheduling. As a result, a lot of new technologies are moving in the same direction. The study presented in this paper relates to the optimum scheduling of an islanded microgrid with three conventional DGs, one wind farm, and one solar power plant. A new improved method Levy Dingo Optimization algorithm (LDOA) of already existing technique named as Dingo Optimization algorithm (DOA) is designed and successfully tested on 23 bench-mark functions. Further, this hybrid technique is implemented on Economic load and Emission dispatch, Combined Eco-nomic Emission Dispatch (CEED) by considering various integration of distributed generators which is going to share the load for 24 h. The efficacy of the proposed technique is tested and compared with some current techniques like GWO, PSO, SOS, DE, and WOA as well as with newly developed approaches like DOA. In all four instances, i.e., without taking into account solar energy, without taking into account wind energy, without taking into account renewable energy sources and considering all five sources, the suggested solution outperforms the existing strategies, indicating that it has a lot of potential in this field. © 2023 Tanuj Mishra, Amit Kumar Singh and Vikram Kumar Kamboj.},

	abstract = {A paradigm change toward a more consumer approach has been observed in Industry 4.0, moving away from cyber-physical platforms (CPS) that seek for huge automation. The development of hyper cognitive systems, the incorporation of extended and virtual reality, the prototyping of digital machinery, and twin designs have all been cited as contributing factors to the shift. The collaborative robots, trusted machine boundaries, and supply chains powered by artificial intelligence (AI). It is anticipated that this new trend, known as Industry 5.0, would go beyond the purview of Industry 4.0 ecosystems and use large production with user-centric customization. Industry 5.0 is anticipated to support a variety of industrial verticals, including healthcare, smart agriculture, aircraft, microgrids, and supply chain manufacturing ecosystems. In contrast, information is shared across numerous heterogeneous networks that span various authority domains. So, for the industrial perimeters to synergize and be secure, trusted and secure data communication is essential. Due to its intrinsic property of absoluteness, chronological, and integrity in industrial systems, one of the most promising technologies for enhancing the security of Industrial 5.0 environments is blockchaintechnology.. Only a few books are suggested that outline the applications for Industry 5.0 that are supported by Blockchain. The piece delivers a groundbreaking study on Block chain's role in Industry 5.0 as a security enabler. With the use of a subjective survey method and study objectives, we were able to identify the most pressing drivers, potential uses, and present an institutional vision for Blockchain-based Industry 5.0 across many different sectors.

	abstract = {Using renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels is one of the best solutions to over-come greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, in designing clean power generation microgrids, the economic aspects of using renewable energy technologies should be considered. Furthermore, due to the unpredictable nature of renewable energy sources, the reliability of renewable energy microgrids should also be evaluated. Optimized hybrid microgrids based on wind and solar energy can provide cost-effective power generation systems with high reliability. These microgrids can meet the power demands of the consuming units, especially in remote areas. Various techniques have been used to optimize the size of power generation systems based on renewable energy to improve efficiency, maintain reliability, improve the power grid’s resilience, and reduce system costs. Each of these techniques has shown its advantages and disadvantages in optimizing the size of hybrid renewable energy systems. To increase the share of renewable energies in electricity supply in the future and develop these new technologies further, this paper reviews the latest and most efficient techniques used to optimize green microgrids from an economical and reliable perspective to achieve a clean, economical, and highly reliable microgrid. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {The development of energy management tools for next-generation Distributed Energy Resources (DER) based power plants, such as photovoltaic, energy storage units, and wind, helps power systems be more flexible. Microgrids are entities that coordinate DERs in a persistently more decentralized fashion, hence decreasing the operational burden on the main grid and permitting them to give their full benefits. A new power framework has emerged due to the integration of DERs-based microgrids into the conventional power system. With the rapid advancement of microgrid technology, more emphasis has been placed on maintaining the microgrids' long-term economic feasibility while ensuring security and stability. The objective of this research is to provide a multi-objective economic operation technique for microgrids containing air-conditioning clusters (ACC) taking demand response into account. A dynamic price mechanism is proposed, accurately reflecting the system's actual operational status. For economic dispatch, flexible loads and air conditioners are considered demand response resources. Then, a consumer-profit model and an AC operating cost model are developed, with a set of pragmatic constraints of consumer comfort. The generation model is then designed to reduce the generation cost. Finally, a microgrid simulation platform is developed in MATLAB/Simulink, and a case is designed to evaluate the proposed method's performance. The findings show that consumer profit increases by 69.2% while ACC operational costs decrease by 18.2%. Moreover, generation costs are reduced without sacrificing customer satisfaction. © 2023, Diponegoro university Indonesia - Center of Biomass and Renewable Energy (CBIORE). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As a new form of technology, blockchain has much to offer. The technology has a wide range of potential uses and advancements, depending on the field of application. However, further study is required to realise the potential of advanced technologies like Blockchain and smart contracts. There is a lot of potential for investigation because the technology is so new. This research looked at the origins of the Blockchain and analysed several different blockchain solutions. Ethereum was discovered to be the most often used platform for constructing distributed apps after being compared to other platforms. Therefore, a distributed smart energy microgrid application will be built on the Ethereum platform. There is a coin, or token, exclusive to each blockchain platform. Bitcoin's relationship to other cryptocurrencies was measured using the Karl Pearson correlation coefficient. The research concludes that ether's price is most sensitive to changes in the price of bitcoin. On a preferred Ethereum network, a distributed application for managing smart microgrids has been built. The smart contract constitutes the heart of this programme. As a result, we also take care of the smart contract's layout, coding, and optimization. In comparison to the original, less GAS is consumed by this smart contract. The entire distributed app has been built and thoroughly tested. Smart Energy Microgrid Distributed Application framework results demonstrate that the application functioned as expected.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The resilience of the power grid is taking a vital role in the energy supply and distribution process. But due to the rapid growth of integration of renewable distributed energy sources to the traditional power grid, the nature of the trading system is shifted from the centralized to decentralized or distributed manner. Blockchain is one of the most emerging security technologies that change the dimension of the financial and energy sector with openness and complete freedom. Blockchain implemented distributed energy trading promotes decentralized electricity markets. The physical system consists of the planning of the routing of energy from one place to another. A user can not send power to another customer in any severe outage or natural disaster in a traditional system. The user cannot participate in the trade globally. So in this proposed methodology, the connections of each customer to the central grid through several microgrids have been shown. In this work, an innovative approach in trading and finding a solution to a payment method is proposed. Ethereum blockchain-based smart contracts completed the entire trading system in automation mode in our proposed system. Any power outage at one place can be compensated by routing a new path of energy inflow from another active source, which enhances the system's resiliency to a certain degree. While trading, no third parties will be engaged so that the transaction is efficient and fast.  © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {The integrated exploitation of different energy infrastructures in the form of multi-energy systems (MESs) and the transformation of traditional prosumers into smart prosumers are two effective pathways to achieve net-zero emission energy systems in the near future. Managing different energy markets is one of the biggest challenges for the operators of MESs, since different carriers are traded in them simultaneously. Hence, this paper presents a hierarchical decentralized framework for the simultaneous management of electricity, heat and hydrogen markets among multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) integrated with smart prosumers. The market strategy of MEMGs is deployed using a hierarchical framework and considering the programs requested by smart prosumers. A deep learning-based forecaster is utilized to predict uncertain parameters while a risk-averse information gap decision theory (IGDT)-based strategy controls the scheduling risk. A new prediction-based mechanism for designing dynamic demand response (DR) schemes compatible with smart prosumers’ behavior is introduced, and the results illustrate that this mechanism reduces the electricity and heat clearing prices in peak hours by 17.5% and 8.78%, respectively. Moreover, the results reveal that the introduced structure for hydrogen exchange through the transportation system has the ability to be implemented in competitive markets. Overall, the simulation results confirm that the proposed hierarchical model is able to optimally manage the competitive markets of electricity, heat and hydrogen by taking advantage of the potential of smart prosumers. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The efficiency of on-site consumption of new energy and the economy of dispatching strategy for that in modern microgrids are increasingly concerning, which are closely related to the microgrid control model with source-load uncertainty. To this end, this paper proposes the multiagent hierarchical IQ ()-HDQC regulation strategy to realize the source-load-storage-charging collaborative control of the microgrid model with high-permeable new energy. The first layer adopts the IQ () strategy, which avoids the overestimation and underestimation problems of traditional reinforcement learning by the coupled estimation method. The second layer adopts the HDQC allocation strategy, which solves the problem of low utilization of new energy in the proportional allocation method and improves the adaptability of the regulation strategy in the complex stochastic environment. The interaction of the two-layer strategies realizes the source-network-load-storage-charge global dynamic interactive regulation of microgrids. Indicators of energy efficiency are constructed in this paper to measure the simulation results. And the superiority of the proposed strategy is verified through the simulation results of the microgrid system.  © 2023 Songsong Chen et al.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, microgrids are emerging as an invaluable framework for the integration of renewable energy sources and demand response programs. In such systems, energy storage facilities are also frequently deployed to properly manage surplus energy from renewable sources on pursuing more efficient management of the system. Hybrid storage systems in which various storage facilities are combined may result in a more effective solution than only considering one storage technology. This way, the good features of the different technologies may be jointly exploited while their drawbacks are minimized. Due to the large-scale integration of renewable energies in this kind of grid, coping with uncertainties becomes a critical issue. Moreover, the operation of microgrids frequently deals with other kinds of uncertainties related to energy pricing from the upscale grid (in the case of grid-connected mode) or local demand. This way, proper modeling of uncertainties is essential for adequately operating these systems. This paper contributes to this pool by developing a novel interval-based formulation, for optimal scheduling of microgrids considering battery and pumped-hydro storage systems. To achieve this goal, the optimal scheduling of a microgrid with pumped-hydro and battery energy storage considering demand response is modeled, firstly. Then, the new interval-based formulation is used to cope with the uncertainties. Finally, the suggested model is verified using simulations in various cases, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the novel interval-based formulation for the optimal scheduling of microgrid with pumped-hydro and battery energy storage under uncertainty. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

This article proposes a new model for the energy management system of a home microgrid integrated with a battery ESS (BESS). The proposed dynamic model integrates a deep learning (DL)-based predictive model, bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM), with an optimization algorithm for optimal energy distribution and scheduling of a BESS-by determining the characteristics of distributed resources, BESS properties, and the user’s lifestyle. The aim is to minimize the per-day electricity cost charged by time-of-use (TOU) pricing while considering the day-basis peak demand penalty. The proposed system also considers the operational constraints of renewable resources, the BESS, and electrical appliances.

	abstract = {Renewable energy penetration increases Smart Grid (SG) instability. A power balance between consumption and production can mitigate this instability. For this, intelligent and optimizing techniques can be used to properly combine and manage storage devices like Electric Vehicle Batteries (EVBs) with Demand-Side Management (DSM) strategies. The EVB helps distribution networks with auxiliary services, backup power, reliability, demand response, peak shaving, lower renewable power production’s climate unpredictability, etc. In this paper, a new energy management system based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is developed to maximize the performance of islanded SG-connected EVBs. The proposed ANN controller can operate at specified periods based on the demand curve and EVB charge level to implement a peak load shaving (PLS) DSM strategy. The intelligent controller’s inputs include the time of day and the EVB’s State of Charge (SOC). After the controller detects a peak demand, it alerts the EVB to start delivering power. This decrease in peak demand enhances the load factor and benefits both SG investors and end users. In this study, the adopted SG includes five parallel Distribution Generators (DGs) powered by renewable resources, which are three solar Photovoltaics (PVs) and two Wind Turbines (WTs). Sharing power among these DGs ensures the SG’s stability and efficiency. To fulfill demand problem-free, this study dynamically alters the power flow toward equity in power sharing using virtual impedance-based adaptive primary control level. This study proposes a decentralized robust hierarchical secondary control system employing Genetic Algorithm (GA)-optimized Proportional-Integral (PI) controller parameters with fine-grained online tuning using ANNs to restore frequency and voltage deviations. The proposed system is evidenced to be effective through MATLAB simulations and real-time data analysis on the ThingSpeak platform using internet energy technology. Our presented model not only benefits users by enhancing their utility but also reduces energy costs with robust implementation of a control structure by restoring any frequency and voltage deviations by distributing power equally among DGs regardless of demand condition variations. © 2023 by the authors.},

Long-duration flywheel energy storage is considered a new contender in the energy storage market. This energy storage technology has been previously evaluated in a techno-economic study, but it did not consider uncertainties in the model input data. In this work, stochastic techno-economic comparison is performed using microgrid modeling and Monte-Carlo methods to compare long-duration flywheels, lithium-ion batteries, and lead-acid batteries for isolated microgrid and industrial facility. Results generally show a relatively high probability for long-duration flywheels to yield a lower leveized cost of storage (LCOS) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) compared to lithium-ion batteries in 2020. Higher probability can be attained when the overnight component cost of long-duration flywheels is reduced or when overnight diesel prices are high. However, the chances of long-duration flywheels yielding lower LCOS and LCOE rapidly decreases as time progresses. Long-duration flywheel manufacturers and promoters must find ways to accelerate price reduction by 2.5× from baseline to secure a better chance of yielding a lower LCOS in 2050. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

However, despite the progress in phasor measurement technology, the performance of the signal processing module is still an active research area due to the challenge of phasor and frequency estimation under dynamic conditions. This paper proposes a signal processing technique for frequency and phasor estimation based on discrete-time analytic (DTA) signals. First, a new method is proposed for computing the DTA signal directly in the time domain. The DTA signal is then approximated using a first-order Taylor series expansion that forms the basis of the tracking method, essentially ensuring that the DTA signal is generated at the exact value of the estimated frequency. The proposed method is accurate as it is based on time-domain least squares estimation; it also meets real-time computing requirements because it employs a single factorization of the gain matrix to achieve the solution. Numerical results are reported under both steady-state and dynamic conditions, showing the proposal's viability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change and the associated global warming raise the possibility of weather-related natural disasters. Power outages due to natural catastrophes cause substantial financial loss. Moreover, an uninterrupted power supply is essential in disaster-prone areas to continue rescue and other humanitarian activities. Therefore, energy systems must be resilient to withstand power outages due to natural events. Resilience and enhancement techniques, and schemes of integrated electricity and microgrids’ heat demand during power outages, were mainly overlooked in the earlier analysis. Therefore, this analysis aims to analyze a grid-tied microgrid’s survivability during a power outage due to a natural disaster in Texas, USA. Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) is used to optimize various energy resources, such as PV, battery, grid, and combined heat and power (CHP) for Texas, USA. These technologies were run in an outage condition to observe their resiliency benefits. To determine the resilience performance of the CHP/PV/battery system for the hospital building, a new probabilistic approach was applied. A 24-h outage was simulated in REopt lite software, and this study found that the PV/battery/CHP system could easily withstand the outage. The optimum system consists of 3933 kW of PV, 4441 kWh of storage, and a CHP unit having a capacity of 208 kW. The proposed microgrid emits 79.81% less CO2 than the only grid system. The microgrid has a net benefit of $1,007,204 over the project duration. The introduction of the proposed microgrid will bring about life-cycle savings (LCS) of 37.02 million USD over the project’s lifespan. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things and Smart Grid (IoTSG) applications have a broader application in the industrial monitoring environment, including workflow automation, predictive maintenance, inventory monitoring, alerting in the event of any deviations, remote equipment management, quality control, supply chain optimization, and so on. Smart grid enhances transmission line operation and allow for speedier system restoration following a fault. It also helps to reduce power costs. In this chapter, the authors investigate the use of IoTSG in energy management, which is critical in every industrial unit. IoTSG is crucial in the monitoring, control, and conservation of energy in the industrial environment. The function and uses of IoTSG in the banking, automobile, and healthcare sectors are thoroughly examined in this chapter. Banking, as an industry, is critical to the economic stability of the country. IoT has a big impact on many aspects of the banking business, including customer relationship management, lending sanctioning, customer service, leasing finance automation, and so on. Similarly, the smart grid uses cutting-edge technologies to solve difficulties with energy systems in banks. Smart grids play an important role in reducing energy usage in banks by supplementing renewable energy and the green environment. The deployment of IoTSG in automobiles is critical. Better fleet and driver management, predictive maintenance, real-time vehicle telematics, and in-car infotainment are all made possible by IoT. IoT applications are also critical in linked autos and fleet management. With electric vehicles gaining popularity in recent years, the smart grid has the potential to revolutionise the face of the automobile industry. IoT enables healthcare professionals to be more watchful and engage with patients proactively. Data collected from IoT devices can help doctors and surgeons choose the optimal treatment plan for their patients. IoT devices equipped with sensors are utilised to determine the real-time position of medical equipment. The deployment of medical personnel at various sites may also be analysed in real-time. Smart microgrids may be used to successfully control hospital energy costs. IoTSG is a technology-enabled network that enables people to accomplish more with fewer resources. As all industries require better energy management, the scope of IoTSG is expected to go up in future as the new applications of these smart devices are expected to be explored continuously. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

	abstract = {The transformation of traditional power systems into micro and smart grids has become necessary with recent advancements in technology. However, these new systems often have low inertia, which can lead to instability, decreased power quality, and potential blackouts. There are two methods for controlling microgrids: centralized and decentralized controllers. Each method provides different advantages and has some limitations. This paper focuses on the reliability of central and decentralized controlled microgrids. It reviews the reliability of microgrids using both centralized and decentralized controllers, and explains various methods and analysis that can be applied. Examples which analyses reliability assessment of microgrid central controller are given. Examples employed different methods such as the Monte Carlo simulation, the Markov Chain process, the fast decoupled load flow simulation method and hybrid methods. Then, centralized and decentralized microgrids reliability is analyzed and compared through an example with Markov Chain Modeling and reliability indices. It is understood that the microgrid central controller has to be survive all the time otherwise it is very likely to see the grid failure. Also, it is seen that decentralized architecture is crucial with regard to reliability because centrally controlled microgrids are prone to failures due to their single point of failure. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Microgrids are currently one among the most extensively employed techniques in the power network to lower system losses and raise the reliability of electrical systems. Power project integration typically entails expanding the network of an existing power system with new distributed energy sources, which may have a compensating device and may not have a compensating device. Power project integration often entails connecting new energy resources to an existent power system network, such as wind and PV generating units parallel and series compensating devices. The topology and behaviour of the dynamic system have changed, necessitating the development of a new protective method. To combine various power sources and different loads in a smart grid system, quick fault detection algorithmic approaches are now required. With the aid of new technology, the protective strategy must offer parametric monitoring in addition to physical monitoring. The Internet of Things is a popular technology for monitoring electric protective systems in a variety of environmental settings. The detailed coefficients of the Bior1.5 wavelet are designed to detect defective lines and pinpoint their locations, and the ANN (artificial neural network) technique is used to determine where the fault is located within a power line. This suggested solution offers a neuro-wavelet protection mechanism for a six-terminal transmission system that integrates a hybrid energy source in a smart environment powered by the Internet of Things under different types of faults. © 2022, The Institution of Engineers (India).},

However, MG is exposed to some power quality (PQ) issues such as harmonics and voltage sag/swell especially during unbalanced loading. To overcome these challenges, isolated areas adopting DG technology rely on ensuring an active compensation of PQ on each standalone micro-source. This paper addressed a control strategy for a specific implementation named 3P four-leg inverters (3P4LI). This implementation is based on DG connection to improve the output voltage regulation, total harmonic distortion (THD) and unbalanced load under various load types. A new control architecture named triple-loop compensation (TLC) based on PI, PR, and feedforward schemes, is proposed. Proposed TLC parameters are optimized based on a multi-objective function under the constraints to compensate for the voltage regulation, THD mitigation, system stability, and unbalanced load compensation to meet the recommended standards. The proposed strategy has proven that the system voltage has been regulated successfully for both 3P/1P loads with minimum error. The voltage unbalanced factor (VUF) has been successfully minimized during aggressive loading. The TLC performance has met the objectives ensuring 5–6 times enhanced accuracy compared to the previous work. © 2023},

	abstract = {In a power system, distributed energy resources, including renewables, are advantageous for reducing power transmission losses and environmental pollution. However, increasing penetration of distributed renewable energy sources is challenging as they may pose security issues to the grid and centralized control of quantum number of such sources is quite impossible. Microgrid based distribution system is facilitating integration of distributed renewable energy sources as they can supply the local loads and reduce burden on the grid. Moreover, distributed control mechanism of different microgrids enhances the functioning efficiency of the grid. However, intermittent and uncertain nature of renewables leads into demand-supply imbalance in a microgrid. Networked microgrids is new concept where the energy sharing between the microgrids may encourage renewable integration and reduce demand-supply imbalance. In order to manage such energy sharing among the different components in a microgrid or different microgrids in a networked structure, an appropriate energy management approach is necessitated. Transactive energy is an emerging technology for energy management in the distribution system, which uses market mechanisms for energy management. This paper discusses various types of market structures and market clearing approaches in transactive energy framework for energy management. Moreover, techno-economic perspectives of utility in transactive energy trading, such as network constraints and network usage charges, are elaborated.

	abstract = {Smart grid plays a vital role in energy management systems. It helps to mitigate the demand side management of electricity by managing the microgrid. In the modern era, the concept of hybrid microgrids emerged which helps the smart grid management of electricity. Additionally, the Internet of Things (IoT) technology is used to integrate the hybrid microgrid. Thus, various policies and topologies are employed to perform the task meticulously. Pakistan being an energy deficient country has recently introduced some new policies such as Energy Wheeling Policy (EWP), Energy Import Policy (EIP), and Net Metering/Distributed Generation Policy (NMP) to manage the electricity demand effectively. In addition, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (EECA) has also been introduced. In this paper, we present the overview and impact of these policies in the context of the local energy market and modern information and communication mechanisms proposed for smart grids. These new policies primarily focus on energy demand–supply for various types of consumers such as the demand for bulk energy for industrial ventures and the distributed production by consumers. The EWP deals with obtaining power from remote areas within the country to ease the energy situation in populated load centers and the EIP highlights energy import guidelines from foreign countries. The NMP deals with the integration of renewable energy resources and EECA is more focused on the measures and standardization for energy efficiency and conservation. The benefits and challenges related to EWP, NMP, and EIP have also been discussed concerning the present energy crisis in Pakistan. The generalized lessons learned and comparison of a few aspects of these policies with some other countries are also presented. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The development of AC distribution systems provides for the seamless integration of low-voltage microgrids with distributed energy resources (DERs). This poses new challenges for the control of normal, emergency, and post-emergency states of microgrids, calling for the creation and development of information and communications technology infrastructure. Power converters/inverters that are used to integrate renewable DERs lack inertia. Along with them, fossil fuel-fired generation units are also being integrated into microgrids. These include gas generator sets, diesel generator sets, and microturbines, having small (up to 1–2 s) values of mechanical inertia constants—Tj. This leads to an increase in the rate of transients by a factor of 5–10. Under these conditions, the technical requirements for the speed of automatic power flow control systems, as well as the methods they rely on, have to be reconsidered. Microgrids include DC microgrids, AC microgrids, and hybrid (AC-DC) microgrids. In the case of hybrid microgrids, DERs are connected to the DC grid and are integrated into the AC grid through a common inverter. The complexity of the task of microgrid control is due to the need to choose properly the type and extent of control actions so as to prevent the emergence and development of accidents. The employed control methods must ensure the reliable power supply to consumers and the quality of power in microgrids, as well as the reliable operation of the external distribution systems into which they are integrated.

	abstract = {During the development of the S3Unica project (Smart Specialisation University Campus) and its application in the ASSET project (Advanced Systems Studies for Energy Transition), both within the European Commission, the resolution of the distributed energy generation model was proposed through the creation of an algorithm that would allow the shared market between producers and consumers. From this premise arose the need to create a replicable system to resolve this situation in the new shared generation environment, using low-cost technologies. This work develops the scalable method for resource management technologies (SMART), based on stochastic procedures, which generates microgrids with an integrated energy market. The interest of this work is based on the incorporation of real-time analysis, applying stochastic methods, and its fusion with probabilistic predictive methods that evolve and harmonise the results. The fact that the process is self-learning also enables the use of metadomotic as a tool for both comfort improvement and energy sharing. The most important results developed were the design of the internal scheme of the low-cost SMART control device together with the developments of both individual and collective resolution algorithms. By achieving the incorporation of internal and external producers in the same numerical procedure, the distributed and hybrid generation models are solved simultaneously. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) are a rapidly growing technology which can lower greenhouse-gas emissions in the transport and energy sectors. The EV batteries can discharge the stored energy back to grid, also known as Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) which can support the integration of variable distributed renewable generation. Previous research identified financial barriers to the implementation of V2G, however, recent advancements in battery technology present new opportunities to make V2G technology viable. Using the current and predicted EV technology trends, this paper evaluates the annual operation and benefits of EVs and V2G in a microgrid environment and demonstrates different modes of operation. Guided by the gaps identified in the literature, one of the main contributions of this research is to uncover the impact of EV charging scenarios on the V2G operations. Furthermore, the research reveals the interactions between V2G and variable renewable generation coupled with utility scale battery over yearlong simulations to assess seasonal characteristics of V2G operations, which was mostly unexplored to date. Simulation results indicate that the operation of V2G in an optimised microgrid environment improves the economic operation of the system and reduces the levelized cost of electricity by up to 5.7%. Additionally, V2G provides more benefit to grids with higher solar generation proportion The results suggest that the latest advancements in EV technology have improved the economic viability of V2G as well as its potential to improve grid efficiency through providing additional storage capacity and peak demand management. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {For several years, microgrids (MGs) integrated with smart grids have been presented as one of the promising solutions for better integration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). As a result, the interest for the development of MGs has increased. Due to the variability of RES as well as the non-synchronization of intermittent RES production and energy consumption, new storage systems have emerged. The integration of hydrogen produced via water electrolysis powered by RES, the production of electricity through fuel cells (FCs) and the storage of hydrogen are becoming more and more attractive. In this paper, a multistage power and energy management strategy (MSPEMS) is presented for a MG with photovoltaic (PV) as a RES and a battery energy storage system, a FC and an Electrolyzer. The objective is to solve a unit commitment problem considering the different constraints of the MG components. The power management system (PMS) is based on a Distributed explicit model predictive control (DeMPC), whereas the energy management system (EMS) relies on a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) optimization problem. The interaction between the power management system (PMS) and the energy management system (EMS) is analyzed in order to improve their effectiveness. The PMS and the EMS are almost always developed separately and their interaction is not investigated. This point is an important contribution to the scientific community and the development of hybrid installations with intermittent sources, especially for hydrogen technologies. The performance of the power and energy management strategy (PEMS) is evaluated using simulation results and different predefined key performance indicators (KPI). The performance analysis shows that the proposed MSPEMS avoid inadequate start-up of the FC and the Electrolyzer. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microgrid (MG) technologies offer users attractive characteristics such as enhanced power quality, stability, sustainability, and environmentally friendly energy through a control and Energy Management System (EMS). Microgrids are enabled by integrating such distributed energy sources into the utility grid. The microgrid concept is proposed to create a self-contained system composed of distributed energy resources capable of operating in an isolated mode during grid disruptions. With the Internet of Things (IoT) daily technological advancements and updates, intelligent microgrids, the critical components of the future smart grid, are integrating an increasing number of IoT architectures and technologies for applications aimed at developing, controlling, monitoring, and protecting microgrids. Microgrids are composed of various distributed generators (DG), which may include renewable and non-renewable energy sources. As a result, a proper control strategy and monitoring system must guarantee that MG power is transferred efficiently to sensitive loads and the primary grid. This paper evaluates MG control strategies in detail and classifies them according to their level of protection, energy conversion, integration, benefits, and drawbacks. This paper also shows the role of the IoT and monitoring systems for energy management and data analysis in the microgrid. Additionally, this analysis highlights numerous elements, obstacles, and issues regarding the long-term development of MG control technologies in next-generation intelligent grid applications.

	abstract = {Power systems are undergoing rapid transitions to incorporate renewable sources of generation and to combat climate change. The next stage of transitions will lead to a shift from large-scale, centralized systems to networks of small-sized, distributed electricity systems, which require distributed or decentralized ledgers for database management for efficient transactions. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) are a form of decentralized ledgers where the transactions (energy, information, and money) among various entities are maintained. One such DLT is blockchain technology which offers several advantages. Data recorded in blockchains are difficult to tamper with; have privacy protection; facilitate fast, accurate, and real-time settlement of financial transactions. Contemporary research has started focusing on their possible applications in energy systems. State-of-the-art suggests that while business and market aspects have been extensively discussed, the electrical constraints and implementation methodologies have not been adequately addressed. Furthermore, all the reviewed projects have implemented only peer-to-peer transactions that are not scalable. To incorporate the new entities like prosumers, inter-microgrid transactions, and interactions with the legacy power grid, new structural and operational frameworks are necessary. The proposed research explores the possibility of developing blockchain enabled smart microgrids (BSMG) with the above frameworks. It aims to build a conceptual framework of BSMG, including the transaction protocols and process flows. It proposes the inclusion of network constraints in a three-level transaction setup executed over a four-layered architecture. Another practical challenge is that BSMGs may be set up on different blockchain platforms. Hence, this paper also proposes implementing Inter-Blockchain Protocol for the first time to include interoperability and communication between different platforms. Finally, the performance metrics that will be used to validate the BSMGs are outlined. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The large-scale multi-objective optimization problem exist widely in reality while they have complex constraints. The simultaneous effect of the large-scale decision variables and the complexity of constraints makes the traditional multi-objective evolutionary algorithm face great challenges. For the large-scale of decision variables, some reference vector-guided, competitive group optimization-based and pairwise child generation-based algorithms have improved the search efficiency of constrained LSMOPs. However, these algorithms encounter difficulties in handling large-scale decision variables and complex constraints at the same time. In this paper, a reference vector-guided with dominance co-evolutionary multi-objective algorithm is proposed to solve constrained large-scale multi-objective problems. First, a reference vector is employed to guide several sub-populations with a fixed number of neighborhood solutions. Then, a new environmental selection is constructed using the angle penalty distance with dominance relationship. This new environmental selection strategy greatly enhances selection pressure. At the same time, a co-evolutionary constraint handling technology is applied to efficiently span the infeasible region. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on constrained large-scale multi-objective problems with 100, 500 and 1000 decision variables. In addition, the impact of each component of the proposed algorithm is examined for the overall performance of the algorithm and tested in a practical application in microgrids. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in constrained large-scale multi-objective optimization. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {One of the reasons for the emerging adoption of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly photovoltaic (PV) and storage, is the impressive decrease in technology costs over the last years together with favorable policy and regulatory environments that created early-stage incentives to the proliferation of these assets. However, when looking at the next decade, the evolution of the regulatory framework and the trajectory of technology costs are difficult to predict. This uncertainty poses a new challenge to prosumers and microgrid owners who are trying to find the best moment to invest in these DERs. In particular, unpredictable changes in the conditions of the investments may translate into economic risks to potential DER adopters, which raises the need for new risk-mitigation methods to support their investment decisions. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-period DER investment model with economic risk constraints, considering technology costs and regulatory uncertainties. A case study, involving a large building in California, is used to show that different types of economic risk constraints can affect not only the size, but also the optimal timing of these investments in a multi-year planning horizon with significant DER technology costs and regulatory uncertainties. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Given the uncertainty around climate change and the need to design systems that anticipate future needs, risks, and costs or values related to resilience, the current rules-based regulatory and policy frameworks designed for the centralized system of large-scale energy generation and delivery may not be ‘fit for purpose' for smaller scale local installations centered on community microgrids. This research examines regulatory challenges and potential impediments to implementing a multi-customer community-based microgrid in California through discussion of lessons learned in current pilot projects supported in part by initiatives of the California Energy Commission's Electric Program Investment Charge (EPIC). The extent to which regulation has the flexibility to anticipate future needs and risks and support experimentation is evaluated in light of the state's complex and evolving energy system requirements. To illustrate challenges, two case studies of EPIC-supported projects are included. Multiple uncertainties, including future impacts of climate change, energy demands, and advances in technology, highlight the potential need to rethink best approaches to energy regulation. Principles drawn from Resilience Thinking and Anticipatory Regulation are discussed for their potential value in supporting development of new models for community-scale energy production, distribution, and use. Drawing on the experiences of the pilot projects, suggested principles to guide a new regulatory regime specific to microgrids are proposed. Copyright © 2023 Aczel and Peffer.},

	abstract = {Load-shedding is an effective control strategy to balance power generation and load demand, which is essential to maintain power system stability. Based on IEC 61850 protocols, this paper integrates a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) platform and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) to propose a new dynamic load-shedding (DLS) control strategy applied in a microgrid (MG) system. Once the power imbalances occur, the proposed DLS strategy calculates the appropriate amount of load shedding and determines the importance of each bus to prioritize loads. To evaluate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed DLS strategy, this work applies to a specific MG, which is located in Penghu, Taiwan, and compares the existing conventional under-frequency relay protections. Validation is performed by the Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS&#x002F;E) software simulations in three realistic scenarios. The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and metaheuristic algorithms to forecast power imbalances has been widely investigated recently. Readers require a strong background in mathematics to realize the principles. In contrast, the proposed protection strategy is easy to understand and implement without complicated algorithms but rather logical concepts. This is one of the significant contributions of the work.

Emergence of new technologies like internet of things (IoT) and system of systems (SoS) is a result of such widespread growth of internet and complex system structures. The distributed network of complex systems and their interactions are necessary to solve and tackle global problems. However, there are challenges in different aspects of complex systems like security, performance, and decision-making that need further investigation. This paper studies the relationship between IoT and SoS and discusses how IoT can be considered a subcategory of SoS. Since SoS is established to analyse and solve problems of complex and large systems and facilitates the challenges in related situations, IoT as a subcategory of SoS would benefit SoS toward systematic growth and efficient problem solving.

	abstract = {Advancing the energy transition in real-world urban settings is attracting interest within interdisciplinary research communities. New challenges for local energy balancing arise particularly in urban neighborhoods where densely populated buildings are facing the needs of the heat transition, an increasing use of battery-electric vehicles and an expansion of renewable energies. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a suitable approach for addressing various interlinked aspects like market mechanisms and processes, technology adoption, different stakeholder roles and the formulation of policy measures. In this work, we analyze peer-reviewed, open-access literature on ABM for energy neighborhoods and discuss key modeling aspects like model purpose and outcome, the logic of agents and decision-making, the treatment of space and time, and empirical grounding. These ABM allow the study of local market mechanisms, local renewable energy generation, microgrids, the unfolding of heat transition, neighborhood mobility and the evaluation of policies like regulation and financial incentives. We find a lack of integrated neighborhood energy assessments that simultaneously look at the different energy forms and applications: heating, electricity, and mobility. We present a consolidated ABM concept that integrates these sectors. Thus, our work contributes to the advancement of ABM and to the understanding of how to promote the transition to a decarbonized society in urban settings. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As the trend towards the decentralization of grids continues, new typologies such as microgrids have gained popularity in recent years. Microgrids offer greater reliability as they can operate both connected to the main grid and in islanded mode. However, the transition to island mode can be even more challenging when a microgrid has a high penetration of intermittent sources like Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs). In this context, designing new controller algorithms is essential to improve frequency support in microgrids with DFIGs. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel Filtered Repetitive Model Predictive Control (FR-MPC) applied to the frequency support in a microgrid. The control structure is applied to the Grid Side Converter (GSC) of a DFIG, while the DC bus voltage is supplied by a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS). The FR-MPC prediction model uses a state-space model with an embedded repetitive action, which has the capacity to mitigate harmonics of the microgrid. However, the inclusion of the repetitive loop degrades the closed-loop robustness. To overcome this limitation, the prediction model features a robustness low pass filter. Furthermore, this paper presents an analysis of the frequency response and pole map of the key components of the controller: the robustness filter, the repetitive loop, and the control law. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller outperforms both the pure Repetitive MPC (R-MPC) and the Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) in terms of performance.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to: first, it studies expert opinions about the future of clean, decentralized energy technology in Australia; second, develop an interpretive and participatory foresighting methodology for a forthcoming study. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports a forecasting study about the future of clean energy. Driven mostly by economics and changing carbon policies, the energy sector is currently moving from fossil fuels to a variety of cleaner technologies. Energy experts have several incommensurate interpretations of how this change will happen. This paper describes the first phase of an ongoing study that foresight clean energy futures in Australia. By building on a participatory method in a scientific expert community, it describes the path from technological presumptions into four parallel yet interconnected scenarios. The paper also explores the social drivers behind these scenarios. Findings: First, energy experts in Australia classify futures into four main scenarios: abundant, where energy will be mostly produced by solar cells; traded, where the future of energy lies in virtual power plants and microgrids; circular, which targets Australia’s NetZero goals through biomaterials, carbon capture and new powerful; secure, which secures the country’s energy supply through coal and nuclear energy. Second, they locate policy as the most important form of wildcards. The policy is multilayered from local to US politics and falls outside the scope of forecasting. Research limitations/implications: The most important limitations of the study are: first, its reliance on scientific and technological experts, which guarantees its scientific validity but may underrepresent the social drivers of energy; second, this study is a methodological pilot of a larger study that will target industrial, commercial and local drivers; third, its focus on Australia, where politics, the size of the country and climate shape the uptake of clean energy in specific ways, most notably in the case of rapid uptake of solar energy. Practical implications: The main practical implications of the paper are its broad focus on clean energy futures and its participatory foresighting approach, which can be repeated in other studies. Social implications: The main social implication of the study is that it clearly shows that a technological perspective is necessary but not sufficient in understanding the future of clean energy. The paper also shows that local drivers importantly mold the future and should be taken into account in future studies and policy. Originality/value: This paper makes two contributions. First, it organizes several technologies into four scenarios that clarify Australia’s clean energy futures better than a piecemeal study would do. Second, it developed and piloted an interpretive participatory methodology for studying futures by building on references from design research. This methodology will be used in subsequent studies. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {One of the major paradigm shifts that will be predictably observed in the energy mix is related to distribution networks. Until now, this type of electrical grid was characterized by an AC transmission. However, a new concept is emerging, as the electrical distribution networks characterized by DC transmission are beginning to be considered as a promising solution due to technological advances. In fact, we are now witnessing a proliferation of DC equipment associated with renewable energy sources, storage systems and loads. Thus, such equipment is beginning to be considered in different contexts. In this way, taking into consideration the requirement for the fast integration of this equipment into the existing electrical network, DC networks have started to become important. On the other hand, the importance of the development of these DC networks is not only due to the fact that the amount of DC equipment is becoming huge. When compared with the classical AC transmission systems, the DC networks are considered more efficient and reliable, not having any issues regarding the reactive power and frequency control and synchronization. Although much research work has been conducted, several technical aspects have not yet been defined as standard. This uncertainty is still an obstacle to a faster transition to this type of network. There are also other aspects that still need to be a focus of study and research in order to allow this technology to become a day-to-day solution. Finally, there are also many applications in which this kind of DC microgrid can be used, but they have still not been addressed. Thus, all these aspects are considered important challenges that need to be tackled. In this context, this paper presents an overview of the existing and possible solutions for this type of microgrid, as well as the challenges that need to be faced now. © 2023 by the authors.},

The proposed universal microgrid validation framework was developed at Advanced Research on Integrated Energy Systems (ARIES) platform at National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado, USA. As the number of intercommunicating devices grow in power systems, along with more integration of inverter-based resources, developing and validating microgrid operation and control algorithms is becoming complex and time-consuming task. The ASSERT framework is designed to provide a comprehensive, accurate, and efficient solution for validating microgrid algorithms. It combines at-scale simulations and real-time emulation to create a virtual environment that closely mimics the behavior of a physical microgrids which are characteristic of future smart distribution systems, such as: (1) increasing variability in the physical size of new energy technologies; (2) requiring control large numbers of interconnected devices, and (3) integrating diverse technologies that have not previously worked together. The paper describes the technical details of the ASSERT framework, its validation process, and its benefits over traditional validation methods. The framework's ability to validate the performance of various algorithms is demonstrated through a case study, which shows that it can effectively identify the weaknesses of an algorithm and optimize its performance. Overall, the ASSERT framework is a promising tool that can significantly enhance the development and validation of microgrid algorithms, leading to more reliable and efficient microgrid operation.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microgrids are decentralized power production systems, where the energy production and consumption are very close to each other. Microgrids generally exploit renewable energy sources, encountering a problem of storage, as the power production from solar and wind is intermittent. This research presents a new integrated methodology and discusses a comparison of batteries and pumped storage hydropower (PSH) as energy storage systems with the integration of wind and solar PV energy sources, which are the major upcoming technologies in the renewable energy sector. We implemented the simulator and optimizer model (HOMER), which develops energy availability usage to obtain optimized renewable energy integration in the microgrid, showing its economic added value. Two scenarios are run with this model—one considers batteries as an energy storage technology and the other considers PSH—in order to obtain the best economic and technical results for the analyzed microgrid. The economic analysis showed a lower net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for the microgrid with PSH. The results showed that the microgrid with the storage of PSH was economical, with an NPC of 45.8 M€ and an LCOE of 0.379 €/kWh, in comparison with the scenario with batteries, which had an NPC of 95.2 M€ and an LCOE of 0.786 €/kWh. The role of storage was understood by differentiating the data into different seasons, using a Python model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted by varying the capital cost multiplier of solar PV and wind turbines to obtain the best optimal economic solutions. © 2023 by the authors.},

This paper presents the development of a time-varying constraint real-time model predictive secondary voltage control (MPVC) strategy for microgrids built up in a multi-class Python environment with InfluxDB and SQLExpress databases storing the controller and microgrid data, and its experimental implementation with Modbus communication to physical devices at the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB) campus microgrid. The microgrid characteristics are described and the experimental setup is presented. The mathematical model of the resource used as case study is obtained through experimental identification, and it is integrated to the MPVC scheme. Polytopic invariant sets are used as terminal sets in the MPVC scheme to ensure stability of the solution, and time-varying constraints of reactive power availability are considered. Validation studies of the proposed control system in computational simulation are presented prior to real application in the UPB campus microgrid. Controller performance results are described for three different implementation scenarios of low, medium and high variability of external disturbances, presenting adequate voltage regulation around the reference value and considerable dependence on the meteorological forecast quality. The model predictive voltage controller is finally benchmarked against a commercial microgrid controller to evaluate its performance, standing out as a more comprehensive and tailor-made solution. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years, due to their ability to supply electricity in isolated places where building electrical transmission networks are expensive, Microgrids (MGs) have gained much attention. A new technology called smart inverters (SIs) is currently implemented in inverter-based MGs. SIs are designed to regulate energy under given standards for connecting inverters to the grid. The closed-loop control of SIs technology is still under study and improvement due to several challenges in fields such as stability and reliability. This paper proposes a DQ control for active power regulation on a single-phase voltage source inverter (SPVSI) using a second order sliding mode control (SMC-2) for addressing the abovementioned concerns. The SMC-2 tuning is performed by a metaheuristic algorithm known as particle swarm optimization (PSO). Moreover, to simulate domestic MGs, the SPSVI operation for tracking active power values is performed by ramp rate references based on standard IEEE Std 1547-2018 for inverters connected to the grid. The SMC-2 was appropriately tuned by a PSO algorithm through MATLABTM and the system simulation through PSCADTM. The results show that the algorithm performed better compared to a classical algorithm such as proportional-integral control in terms of integral absolute error (IAE) and integral square error (ISE).

Data security is a big concern with energy trading; therefore, blockchain technology is being used more and more in energy markets. It has the potential to simplify P2P energy trading. In this paper, blockchain is designed to fit into the decentralized nature of the P2P market, securing the payment mechanism and transaction data store. The blockchain-enabled platform is developed using the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm, and is verified with the help of the Postman application programming interface (API). All transactions involving the buying and selling of energy are handled by a miner without the help of any third parties.

Microgrids should be carefully planned and optimized to meet the power requirements of critical loads and justify their economic viability. Conventional microgrid design approaches consider a fixed power architecture, focusing mainly on improving the financial aspects of the design by sizing its energy sources. This paper introduces a new Vectorial Microgrid Optimization (VMO) design method for critical loads. The proposed VMO improves the microgrid design by 1) incorporating the selection of the microgrid power conversion architecture and the size of the energy sources into a unified design strategy, 2) implementing multi-objective optimization to find the desired balance between the microgrid power supply availability, net present cost, and power efficiency. Through the use of graph theory, the proposed VMO automates the architecture selection process. The benefits of the proposed VMO method are highlighted in a critical load case-study to find the optimal microgrid design. The obtained microgrid design is compared with the results of existing microgrid planning tools and the standard industry approach for powering critical loads.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Adoption of microgrids and related technologies is inevitable, keeping in view of the prosumer-rich modern power systems. With the introduction of a wide range of distributed energy resources on the distribution side, traditional unidirectional power flow is getting altered by bidirectional power flow in the network. With the bidirectional power flow in the network, system complexity is getting intensified to a new level. Additionally, with the introduction of intermittent source-powered distributed energy resources, operation, and maintenance challenges are at an all-time high. Traditional approaches to available tools may not be able to simulate all such newly evolving issues in the last hierarchy of power systems. Although some tools are available for this purpose, some face compatibility issues with the latest available software interface, and some require rigorous training to use them. On the contrary, Typhoon HIL's real-time digital simulator has no compatibility issue with the latest software interface, and the process is comparatively automated to expedite the test process. In this work, the author(s) expound Typhoon HIL real-time digital simulator applications in the context of active distribution network frequency analysis.

These are facing several challenges with renewable energy resources, has high consumption, and the ever-increasing demand for electricity at commercial, residential, and industrial levels. In recent decades, the main grid is facing several challenges related to the integration of renewable energy resources, deployment of grid-level energy storage devices, deployment of new usages such as the electric vehicle, massive usage of power electronic devices at different electric grid stages, and the inter-connection with microgrids and prosumers. This paper aims to identify the challenges, control these perspectives, for attaining the energy infrastructures, to achieve the directions of future research and development, with respect to power generation, transmission, distribution, and consumption. In this study, future smart grids creation and dimensionality reduction with signal handling on the smart grid using, targeted projection pursuit for future smart grids signal analysis is proposed, in which the Signal handling on the smart grid uses Blind equalization and is imposed to transmit the signal which is inferred from the received signal. The smart grid is based on the Non-negative matrix factorization; the Sallen-key topology is implemented to reduce the noise in the signal. Moreover, in this paper, we perform the targeted projection pursuit, the Cognitive Dimensionality Reduction is used for the analysis of n-way arrays, nonlinear dimensionality reduction, and we use the Linear predictive coding, and Hilbert spectrum which represents the spectral envelope of a digital signal of speech in the compressed form. The experiments on the proposed method, show the effectiveness of our method is 92 % well organised with extensive results at Targeted projection pursuit for future smart grids. The signal analysis shows the execution between past research and the ongoing research has achieved an efficiency rate of 92.2 %, in which the current approach outperforms 94.87 % compared existing approach. The analysis of future smart grids creation, Signal Dimensionality Reduction is 75 % higher than the existing analysis.

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of emerging renewable energies plays an undeniable and important role in the development of power systems, and the world is rapidly moving towards decarbonization, which causes great challenges for the real-time balance between electricity supply, demand, distribution system operator (DSO), and the transmission system operator (TSO). Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading through market-based transactions has potential value and implementation as a paradigm shift in the operation of power systems to reduce customer costs so that peers can generate their own energy from renewable or conventional energy sources and transfer energy to other peers. This is an innovative approach to managing the widespread penetration of renewable and distributed energy sources in local microgrids. Also, this market creates a large-scale capacity for the development of new technologies, such as shared battery energy storage systems (SBESS). In this study, an integrated center that includes several battery units called central shared battery energy storage (CSBES) is considered. This unit has a very large capacity to store and discharge energy at a certain time. CSBESS also shares its capacity with customers in the P2P market. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been used to model the optimization of the P2P energy trading market in a decentralized manner. Peers can maximize their level of social welfare by participating in the P2P market and using SBES to reduce their costs by charging and discharging during off-peak and peak consumption times. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Microgrids are highlighted as the technology which can help in providing sustainable and efficient electrical energy solutions. They employ distributed energy resources to efficiently supply local load and increase the reliability of the local network. Design and planning are of a pivotal importance in yielding all of the advantages this concept can provide. Reliability-oriented design is of a special interest for microgrids utilizing a large share of the renewable energy-based, power electronics-interfaced distributed energy resources. A state-of-the-art overview included in this paper has shown that the main reliability-oriented microgrid design improvements are done in the field of distributed energy resources sizing and scheduling combined with the relevant forecasting and optimization methods. It is, further on, concluded that the standard power system reliability assessment within the design often excludes the wear-out failure of power electronics. However, previous field experience has shown that the power electronics is prone to wear-out failure and can have adverse impact on the reliability of the power electronics-dominated system. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the current reliability methods to enable accurate investigation of power electronics reliability and its impact on system design. To do so, the main characteristics of the wear-out modelling concepts together with the recent publications bridging the power electronics and power system reliability are discussed in detail. Finally, the main findings included in this overview paper can serve as basis for development of the new procedures for reliability-oriented design and planning of future, power electronics-dominated microgrids. © 2022 The Author(s)},

The continual requirement to adjust to new load types and production tactics makes the power system more challenging. In order to achieve the desired outcome, communication technology that connects the controller units and electrical devices / sensors for various end users and utilities is crucial.

Considering the limitations presented by the current structure of the power grid, mostly highlighted by the accentuated integration of emerging technologies (ESS, renewables, electric vehicles, and electrical appliances that natively operate in dc), it is extremely pertinent to adopt new topologies, architectures, and paradigms. In particular, decentralized power systems, unified topologies, and correspondent control algorithms are representative of a new trend towards a reduction in the number of power converters. Thus, the developed solution is designed to operaSAVE-15te at a nominal power of 3.6 kW, with a switching frequency of 100 kHz, and in four operation modes concerning power flow: (i) solar PV panels to batteries (PV2B); (ii) solar PV panels to dc grid (PV2G); (iii) batteries to dc grid (B2G); (iv) dc grid to batteries (G2B). Moreover, a dual active bridge converter guarantees galvanic isolation, while two back-end dc–dc converters are responsible for interfacing solar PV panels and batteries. The experimental validation of the proposed unified power converter proves its application value to self-consumption production units. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {With the continuous development of the Internet, the technical requirements for microgrids are also constantly improving. Today, micropower applications are mainly found in industrial and commercial areas, urban areas and remote areas. With the rapid development of computers and telecommunication equipment, microgrids are also integrated into the fields of computers, control technology, algorithm strategies, etc., and gradually change to the direction of automation. Microgrid technology is becoming a new force in network systems to make up for the deficiencies of traditional networks. Therefore, the development of microgrid is very important to the development of power grid. This paper aims to study the integrated dispatch and control system of microgrid based on dynamic programming algorithm. On the basis of analyzing the comparison between dynamic programming algorithm and other algorithms and the requirements of the integrated system of regulation, the integrated dispatching and control system of microgrid is analyzed. In order to verify the advantages of the proposed algorithm, this paper compares the dynamic programming algorithm with the traditional algorithms GA and PSO. The results show that the dynamic programming algorithm can directly calculate the optimal value of multiple data blocks, which speeds up the convergence process, thus greatly reducing the iteration cycle of the algorithm, and can better meet the needs of automatic power generation instruction cycle. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Modern distribution systems and microgrids must deal with high levels of uncertainty in their planning and operation. These uncertainties are mainly due to variations in loads and distributed generation (DG) introduced by new technologies. This scenario brings new challenges to planners and system operators that need new tools to perform more assertive analyses of the grid state. This paper presents an optimization methodology capable of considering uncertainties in the optimal allocation and sizing problem of DG in distribution networks. The proposed methodology uses an interval power flow (IPF) that adds uncertainties to the combinatorial optimization problem in charge of sizing and allocating DG units in the network. Two metaheuristics were implemented for comparative purposes, namely, symbiotic organism search (SOS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). The proposed methodology was implemented in Python® using as benchmark distribution systems the IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus test distribution networks. The objective function consists of minimizing technical losses and regulating network voltage levels. The results obtained from the proposed IPF on the tested networks are compatible with those obtained by the PPF, thus evidencing the robustness and applicability of the proposed method. For the solution of the optimization problem, the SOS metaheuristic proved to be robust, since it was able to find the best solutions (lowest losses) while keeping voltage levels within the predetermined range. On the other hand, the PSO metaheuristic showed less satisfactory results, since for all test systems, the solutions found were of lower quality than the ones found by the SOS. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) have emerged throughout the world as the major means of integrating a variety of distributed energy resource (DER) technologies into the distribution system. These DER technologies are mostly coupled through electronic power converters (EPCs). This fact has created new operation challenges as these converter-interfaced DERs could compromise the MG stability, reliability, and resilience margins. On the other hand, induction motor-type loads (IMs) are dynamic loads with the greatest incidence in distribution grids. Air conditioning (A/C) type loads have IMs among their components. IMs demand considerable amounts of reactive power for their correct operation. In particular, when there are disturbances in MGs with high penetration of these types of loads, the phenomenon of fault-induced delay voltage recovery (FIDVR) occurs. This phenomenon causes problems with the dynamic voltage stability (DVS) due to the deficit and inability to supply reactive power of the DERs generator park composing the MG, which could lead to a voltage collapse. To face these new issues, this work proposes an approach to incorporate flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) controllers, such as an SVC and a DSTATCOM, into the grid as reactive power supply resources for improving the microgrid dynamic voltage stability. The proposal includes the design, optimal location, and dynamic modeling of FACTS devices aiming at enhancing MG operation resilience. For validation of the developed methodology, an MG test system reported in the literature and a real microgrid system of the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador have been used. The results demonstrated the superiority of DSTATCOM over SVC in enhancing DVS, FIDVR mitigation, and consequently operational resilience. © 2013 IEEE.},

This new paradigm facilitates massive integrations of different energy resources and loads, e.g., renewable energy and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, throughout a microgrid with cyber interfaces. The integration of these energy resources and EVs can significantly enhance the microgrid efficiency, reliability, resiliency, and address environmental concerns. Several emerging technologies are required to prepare the cyber-physical infrastructure for this highly integrated grid. This new grid model is highly dependent on the cyber interfaces and communication infrastructure that makes the system vulnerable to cyber disruptions and threats. Considering the interconnected nature of these microgrids, cyber disorders may lead to disastrous consequences; therefore, it is essential to know the vulnerabilities of the grid and design tools to identify and mitigate these threats. This chapter specifically focuses on cybersecurity issues of the microgrid with inverter-based resources (IBRs) and EV charging stations. Due to complexity and unknown behavior of grids with IBRs and EV charging stations, a variety of cyber risks can impact the grid. Therefore, this chapter demonstrates the vulnerabilities of this new grid architecture, including IBRs and EV charging stations.

SESCL’s high level of automation and capacity to fully function in a grid-decoupled way allow for the study and evaluation of yet-to-be-developed tools and algorithms for energy technologies and grid control strategies on the edge of system stability, but in a safe environment. In the context of various European Smart Grid Laboratories, the new concept and specifications of SESCL are outlined in depth. The key advantages of SESCL are highlighted as (i) the provisioning of a fully-automated busbar matrix to provide a very flexible and adjustable microgrid topology; (ii) the capability of load shedding or integration of grid participants, as well as changing the microgrid topology on demand; (iii) and the possibility to control and modify setpoints and operating parameters of grid participants during runtime.

The EMS utilizes predefined criteria and parameters to determine the most suitable energy source for a given time and regulates the operation of loads based on energy availability. The article also delves into the design and sizing of electricity-supplying elements for household loads within the microgrid. To validate the proposed system, prototype elements were tested using an isolated residential microgrid emulator. The emulator proved to be a valuable academic and research tool, enabling multiple experiments and tests in the field of isolated microgrids. It facilitated a better understanding of calculations and theoretical approaches while providing a platform for validation.

How to improve the level of renewable energy consumption and deal with the uncertainty of new energy is of great significance in a microgrid. The article underlines the active microgrid energy management in a microgrid. Firstly, from the perspective of the potential game, the model of the renewable energy, the generalized energy storage and the diesel engine unit is established; Then the generalized energy storage model is constructed to make the flexible load with "virtual energy storage" operate with the energy storage unit in coordination, making a detailed scheduling plan of the flexible load under the incentive of time-sharing price and participating in the optimization of dispatching; At the same time, aiming at the volatility and intermittence of renewable energy, the Conditional Value at Risk(CVaR) model is introduced to quantify the risk cost caused by the uncertainty of the output power of the renewable energy so as to pursue the balance between the risks and the benefits. Simulation results show that the proposed method ensures the autonomy and self-interest of the microgrid individuals, and effectively improves the flexible load’s power consumption curve. The CVaR model proposed has a good robustness, which provides a reference for the balance between the benefits and risks of the renewable energy operators. © 2023 Power System Technology Press.

The research indicators proved that the interest in MGs is growing in numerous countries whose concern is to seek alternative energy generation with renewable energy sources (RES) to supply an increasing demand for energy production and reduce the impacts of atmospheric pollutants. Moreover, the insertion of blockchain technology in the energy market can provide significant advances in the commercialization of electric energy, enabling virtual transactions to be conducted in a decentralized and secure way, managing numerous smart contracts, and contributing reasonably to introducing prosumers in energy transactions in MGs. This systematic review enabled us to shed more light and direct the study methodology to answer the questions surrounding this research. The aspects found explore concepts similar to the characteristics of TE and MGs exposed in the review of indicators. It was possible to perceive that the research strategy was successfully employed and has considerable academic significance, especially in this theme. Additionally, a new approach to the topic was presented by analyzing the interactions of prosumers and utility.

	abstract = {By combining distributed generation, battery storage, and smart meters, microgrid performance can be enhanced. As a result, distributed energy resources (DER) can be intelligently controlled via online platforms. Through integration, prosumers that use decentralized resources like wind power have replaced conventional power customers. Due to the growth and digitalization of the power distribution infrastructure, a new method of exchanging electricity in community microgrids called peer-to-peer (P2P) intratrading has emerged. Blockchain technology is used because it is transparent, secure, and completes transactions quickly. Prosumers, consumers, and owners of renewable energy sources may now trade energy more easily amongst one another. This study develops the P2P paradigm to create a self-sufficient community microgrid system for trading energy. Incorporating peer-to-peer energy trades and a battery backup system, the suggested technique uses blockchain to simulate a decentralized microgrid energy market. The microgrid P2P market's clearing price is established by taking into account customers' expected reactions to price changes, incentivizing consumers and prosumers to alter their patterns of energy usage. A cryptocurrency called Cosmos that is mined and distributed using blockchain technology is also included in the P2P market idea. The results show how automated P2P commerce and adjustable energy storage enable end users to save energy and become more independent. This paper provides a sustainable microgrid energy market model and suggests an approach to improve security by incorporating blockchain technology into current energy management systems. In summary, the paper offers a design paradigm for an independent microgrid system that makes use of distributed energy sources. It demonstrates how end users may gain from energy efficiency and independence while highlighting the possibilities of P2P energy trade and storage variety offered by blockchain. This thorough method provides information on creating a sustainable microgrid energy market and illustrates how blockchain technology can be used to increase the safety of energy management systems. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Over the last several years, microgrids have increasingly become a part of the discussion about technologies that can improve the resilience of modern electrical grids. During extreme situations, microgrids have the capability to provide electrical service to customers within their boundaries when they would otherwise experience disruptions, and, when networked together, provide services to additional customers outside the microgrid boundaries. As a result, these technologies have motivated the community to develop new approaches for leveraging networked microgrid capabilities that utilize increasing levels of modeling sophistication. This has yielded a new challenge, where it has becoming increasingly difficult to fully quantify and evaluate the contribution of such detail. The primary innovation presented in this paper is a method to standardize the approach to quantifying and evaluating these contributions via a declarative modeling approach that supports seamless mix-and-match of representations to ease comparison of modeling approaches and develop comprehensive understandings of how new contributions improve solutions to this problem.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electrical grids are becoming more complex due to an increasing penetration of distributed power generation systems (DPGSs). Examples of DPGSs include renew¬able energy sources such as small water turbines, solar photovoltaic, wind turbines, and small non-renewable sources like engine generators, gas turbines and, fuel cells. DPGSs provide some advantages compared to a traditional system with a cen¬tralized generation of electric power. These technologies place generation close to demand. This improves power quality, reduces feeder losses, and improves the regula¬tion of local voltages. Moreover, it also enhances local reliability due to a decentralized generation structure combined with an effective integration of renewable sources. Nonetheless, DPGSs also pose some challenges that should be addressed for a safe and efficient operation of the power grid. As the number of DPGSs that are connected increases, the grid becomes more difficult to control. Such problem is caused by the interaction between parallel energy sources with variable dispatch times and intermit¬tent production. Therefore, new algorithms should be developed to control the power balance and to protect the distributed sources. In order to address this problem, the concept of microgrid (MG) arises. A MG is a collection of local loads and generators that are coordinated in a decen¬tralized way. The utility sees the MG as a single cell of the power system that behaves as a single producer or load; therefore, it reduces the control burden on the grid. In order to effectively integrate the different types of sources and energy stor¬age systems in a MG, power-electronic equipment is typically used. In particular, VSCs are commonly employed in the interface between the different elements that conform the MG due to their flexibility. They permit to regulate the output volt¬age and balance the power sharing by controlling both the magnitude and phase of their output voltage. Depending on the electrical variables regulated by the voltage source converters (VSCs), two different modes of operations are possible, namely, grid-following converter (GFLC) and grid-forming converter (GFMC). On the one hand, GFLCs usually behave as ideal current sources and they do not provide significant grid support in terms of grid voltage and grid frequency regulation. On the other hand, GFMCs can provide grid support when connected to a weak grid by regulating the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC). These chapters focus on the design of high-performance current and voltage regulators for the control of power converters in a MG. The contents presented in these chapters have been published in seven articles in JCR-indexed journals [2, 1, 8, 4, 5, 6, 7] and have also been presented in six communications to the IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition (ECCE) [10, 9, 11, 12, 3, 13]. © 2022 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	abstract = {Rural electrification should plan the multi-stage implementation of electrification systems considering different distribution options (national grid extension and decentralized off-grid systems) with different energy sources (photovoltaic, wind, diesel, etc.). Most of the existing planning assessment tools search for a static final design and only consider economical and technical criteria, although social and environmental issues have proven essential in ensuring long-term sustainability. In this context, the objective of this paper is to investigate and define how different actions of electricity extension in a region can be gradually organized to maximize the region's overall satisfaction, and which technology options for electricity generation and distribution should be promoted on a regional scale according to economic, technical, socio-institutional and environmental criteria. The obtained solution defines, at each planning stage, to which communities should electricity access be extended and which configuration and sources are used in each community in order to maximize the total satisfaction of the region. This total satisfaction is calculated by means of multicriteria indices that evaluate the energy provided and the suitability of the chosen system designs according to stakeholders’ opinions (experts, promoters, users, among others). A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed to solve the regional multi-stage planning. The model is validated with a computational experiment of 540 randomly generated instances; the results highlight its efficiency. Finally, it is applied to solve a case study of 544 real non-electrified communities in Plateau State (Nigeria) calculating two electrification plans (with a more and less budget-constrained scenario) which are compared with the currently available one. The results show that the proposed new plans significantly increase the total satisfaction obtained in the electrification of the region. The consideration of a less-constrained budget scenario allows the promotion of on-grid MGs based on only photovoltaic without diesel, which is the most satisfying option for the case study from a multicriteria perspective. © 2022 The Author(s)},

This paper presents a new microgrid structure with in-motion electric vehicles as a distributed energy storage system. This structure combines the technology of dynamic wireless charging, allowing in-motion electric vehicles to participate in the energy regulation of the microgrid. The proposed microgrid mainly consists of wind turbines, photovoltaic arrays, as well as dynamic wireless charging facility. Two different planning objectives, i.e., maximizing the microgrid utility and minimizing the total generalized social cost, are investigated respectively. Taking into account the response of EV users to the microgrid capacity plans, we propose a bi-level framework. Further, an algorithm based on the surrogate model is used to solve the bi-level programming, where the radial basis function interpolation model is utilized to approximate the objective function. Finally, in case studies, the influence of parameter variations on the results is explored. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed microgrid capacity planning are demonstrated. Further, through the studies of the uncertainties of wind speed, light intensity, base load, and movable load, it is illustrated that the objective value can maintain good stability under the optimal capacity plan. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Different MPC-based EMS for microgrids have been defined in the literature; however, there is a lack of generality in the proposed that would facilitate adapting to new architectures, energy storage system technology, nature of the bus, application, or purpose. To fill this gap, a novel general formulation that is parameterizable, simple, easily interpretable, and reproducible in different microgrid architectures is presented. This is the result of the development of a novel methodology, which is also presented. It considers the state space formulation of the controller from the initial modelling phase, from the dynamics of the energy storage systems represented by their models to the subsequent definition of the optimisation problem. This is developed through the design of the general cost function and the formulation of constrains, by means of general guidelines and reference values. To evaluate the performance of the developed methodology, simulation tests were carried out for four different microgrid architectures, with different applications and objectives, also considering different generation conditions, demand profiles, and initial conditions. The results showed that, with some simple guidelines and regardless of the case study, the developed MPC controller design methodology can address the technical-economic optimisation problem associated with energy management in microgrids in an easy and intuitive way. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The process of building microgrids on top of existing passive distribution networks warrants a multi-criteria analysis. Besides the calculation of the investment outlays needed for the modernization of distribution networks, such an analysis covers an assessment of the technological and economic effects of building microgrids. The resulting effects depend on the topology and configuration of distribution networks, specific microgrid features, the choice of the current type for the entire microgrid or its individual parts, the methods of connecting distributed energy resources (DERs), the availability and maturity of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, and other factors. Comprehensive input data allow for designing an optimal microgrid configuration, but the main technological and economic effects are determined by the algorithms of operation and the parameter settings of the automatic control system (ACS) and the protection system. The known approaches to designing microgrids focus on addressing basic tasks while minimizing the investment required for their implementation. The above is fully justified when constructing new microgrids, but building microgrids on top of existing distribution networks, given the uniqueness of their topology and configuration, does not allow the use of standardized solutions. The development of approaches to the design of microgrids under such constraints, with minimized investment in the modernization of existing distribution networks, is an urgent task. The use of different types of current for individual microgrid segments determines the choice of the particular ACS and protection system, which depends on the availability of information and communications technology infrastructure. This article contributes a review of approaches to designing AC and AC–DC microgrids so as to maximize their technological and economic effects. We review techniques for analyzing the existing distribution networks aimed at choosing the type of current for the entire microgrid or its individual parts, the optimal points for the connection of microgrids to distribution networks, and the mix and capacity of DERs, with such choices informed by the conditions of the switching devices and information and communications technology infrastructure. This article presents the results of the analysis of approaches to choosing the optimal configuration of microgrids, microgrid ACS, and protection system, with an evaluation of the technological and economic effects subject to the minimization of investment in the modernization of the existing distribution networks. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Electrical energy is very necessary for human life in the modern era. The rising energy prices, depletion of fossil fuels, and instability of the grid are alarming situations. So, it needs a smart solution to ensure the balance between pricing and saving natural resources. Some other issues like environmental change, limitations on installation of new transmission lines, reliability concerns, and considering the expansion in distributed energy generation technologies promise the implementation of distributed generation extensively. The integration of two or more energy supplies in a power system is known as distributed energy resource system. In this study, a university campus is taken as a case study to reduce the energy cost while considering the aforementioned issues. The intelligent source–load–storage coordination scheme is proposed to utilize the available renewable energy resources with storage systems. The proposed linear model is solved in MATLAB using the exact method technique considering the economic parameters. The campus microgrid analysis is not addressed considering the Internet-of-Thing (IoT)-based building, especially in the scenario of Pakistan. The results show the efficacy of the proposed model and can be implemented on the existing campus for source–load–storage coordination as an economical solution.

	abstract = {The definition of an electricity trading protocol among microgrids is not an easy task to perform due to the grid's increasing requirements. In fact, a trading process must provide security and especially privacy of the buyer and seller identities as well as prices. Also, guaranteeing a financial profit to trading parties is of great importnace. Moreover, matching the full distributed paradigm is required since it will be executed in a distributed system. All these constraints must be satisfied with consideration to the computational costs especially data storage. In this paper, an electricity trading protocol is introduced to ensure: (1) the security and privacy of buyers, sellers, and sales information, (2) the trading process distribution, and (3) the minimisation of the stored data. The protocol builds upon the blockchain technology and the Elliptic Curve Cryptography. To achieve the protocol goals, a new architecture based on a concept of membership of microgrids to families and groups of families is defined. The proposed protocol is implemented using Java programming langauge. An honest-but-curious-adversary security model is applied to a formal case study to prove security of the protocol. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Renewable energy integration into existing or new energy hubs together with Green technologies such as Power to Gas and Green Hydrogen has become essential because of the aim of keeping the average global temperature rise within 2 °C with regard to the Paris Agreement. Hence, all energy markets are expected to face substantial transitions worldwide. On the other hand, investigation of renewable energy systems integrated with green chemical conversion, and in particular combination of green hydrogen and synthetic methanation, is still a scarce subject in the literature in terms of optimal and simultaneous design and operation for integrated energy grids under weather intermittency and demand uncertainty. In fact, the integration of such promising new technologies has been studied mainly in the operational phase, without considering design and management simultaneously. Thus, in this work, a multi-period mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is formulated to deal with the aforementioned challenges. Under current carbon dioxide limitations dictated by the Paris Agreement, this model computes the best configuration of the renewable and non-renewable-based generators, their optimal rated powers, capacities and scheduling sequences from a large candidate pool containing thirty-nine different equipment simultaneously. Moreover, the effect of the intermittent nature of renewable resources is analyzed comprehensively under three different scenarios for a specific location. Accordingly, a practical scenario generation method is proposed in this work. It is observed that photovoltaic, oil co-generator, reciprocating ICE, micro turbine, and bio-gasifier are the equipment that is commonly chosen under the three different scenarios. Results also show that concepts such as green hydrogen and power-to-gas are currently not preferable for the investigated location. On the other hand, analysis shows that if the emission limits are getting tightened, it is expected that constructing renewable resource-based grids will be economically more feasible. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {In concern of energy trilemma such as energy security, energy equity, and environmental sustainability, the electric infrastructures are significantly developing the manifold avenues for decentralization, decarbonization, and digitalization. Over the years, the growth of decentralized power systems using distributed energy resources is increasing rapidly, bringing new prospects for local energy trading concerning economic and control operations in a single framework called transactive energy (TE). However, the continuity of power supply after high-disruptive events has remained a potential challenge for the energy market operator. Thus, to triumph over the challenges, this paper proposes a novel TE framework with resiliency consideration. On the other hand, cyber-attacks are an increasing concern, which impacts the digital platform, such as energy digitization. Considering this, homomorphic Blockchain technology is applied to secure the TE platform against cyber-attacks. To show the leveraging capabilities, this paper considers various case studies in the wake of high-disruptive events such as microgrid outage conditions and cyber-attack. The result shows that the proposed TE framework enhances the microgrid benefit and guarantees optimal trading performance. In addition, empowering Blockchain realizes that the security of the system is vital for the TE system when it faces data tampering or any external attacks. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed system are evaluated by cost, benefit, and probability of success. IEEE},

	abstract = {The employment of microgrids and distributed power generation have exponentially increased over recent decades, due in part to the increased inclusion of renewable energies as these technologies become cheaper to install. However, microgrids are highly sensitive to power variation, leading to distortion of the grid voltage (amplitude and frequency changes) which could destabilize the entire microgrid under variation of loads and/or other power sources. In this context, a new control strategy is proposed for a photovoltaic grid connected system, operating under voltage variations typical of a low inertial electric power network. The main problem related to voltage fluctuation is that the variables may take the power converter out of the operating region, and therefore, all controllers, including the maximum power point tracking, will not work as designed. The analysis, based on the mathematical operating region, demonstrates that the control strategy can include overmodulation compensation—to overcome problems related to weak microgrids and systems variations—through the addition of smart power factor imposition and DC-link voltage variation in transient time when the variables are far from the nominal values. The proposal is validated through simulation in PSim®/Matlab® and implementation on a laboratory prototype, showing the feasibility of the designed algorithm. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The development of a network termed microgrid (MG) has been motivated owing to augmentation in renewable energy source (RES) infiltration along with the utilization of enhanced power electronic technologies. Recently, more popularity has been gained by the hybrid MG (HMG). Maintaining the power system's (PS) small-signal stability (SSS) is highly complicated during the energy enhancement of RES. The enhancement of the SSS has been focused on by numerous existing methodologies; however, the optimal solution was not obtained by those methodologies. A new controller with the assistance of bell-curved squirrel search optimization (BCSSO) is proposed to address the aforementioned issue. Initially, for PSs such as photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines, along with fuel cells, a mathematical model is ascertained. Then, in this, the converter design has been developed. The PV's maximum power flow is recognized by maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in the bidirectional switched buck-boost converter (BSBBC), which is utilized in this research, and by utilizing the fuzzy ruled linear quadratic Gaussian (FRLQG), the converters are controlled to assure safe operation along with soft dynamics. By employing the BCSSO, the parameters are modified in this controller which in turn ameliorates the SSS. The experiential evaluation of the proposed system's performance is analogized with the existing methodologies. Consequently, the outcomes confirmed that a better performance was attained by the proposed methodology than the prevailing works.  © 2023 Ginbar Ensermu et al.},

However, when a major amount of distributed energy storage units are in operation, their charge and discharge losses and line transmission losses increase the operating cost of the system, which brings economic problems. A distributed energy storage control strategy aiming at economy is proposed. This method optimizes the active power output between each energy storage unit by establishing a battery energy storage charging and discharging cost model considering line losses, and then using a consensus algorithm to iteratively solve the problem. The consensus algorithm control strategy only needs the information exchange between adjacent nodes, the topology is flexible and simple, and the reliability is high. Finally, four autonomous microgrid clusters are built in a real-time digital simulator (RTDS) to consider four different scenarios and the comparison of different control methods to demonstrate the effectiveness and economy of the proposed autonomous optimal control strategy for distributed energy storage based on the consistency algorithm, which also has good applicability to different communication topologies.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Isolated microgrids are increasingly recognised as an effective platform for the optimal coordination of integrated distributed energy resources – including renewable energy generation and storage technologies – for remote, island, and peripheral communities. However, they require advanced off-grid microgrid capacity planning optimisation models to achieve the globally optimum sizing results. In this context, while considerable attention has been devoted to a range of off-grid microgrid sizing methods, leveraging the potential of metaheuristic optimisation algorithms is less well-explored. Furthermore, there is a general lack of electrified transportation interventions considered during long-term grid-independent microgrid planning phases. In response, this paper introduces a novel metaheuristic-based strategic off-grid microgrid capacity planning optimisation model that is applicable to associated integrated energy and e-mobility resource planning problems. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, three independent microgrid development projects have been considered for three communities residing on Aotea–Great Barrier Island in Aotearoa–New Zealand. The sites of interest have different demand profiles and renewable energy potentials – with consequent changes in the technologies considered in the associate candidate pools. Moreover, to generate key insights into the impact of the forecast uncertainty of different variables on the costing and configuration of the associated microgrids, a number of scenario analyses have been performed. In addition, the numeric simulation results and the associated capital budgeting analyses have demonstrated the economic viability of the project proposals formulated based on the proposed off-grid microgrid planning method, especially with controlling the charging of electric vehicles. Particularly, the potential of the artificial hummingbird algorithm in reducing the total discounted costs of off-grid microgrids by at least ∼6% has been shown. Also, the importance of electric vehicle charging coordination in reducing the off-grid microgrid costs (by at least ∼9%) has been substantiated. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {In recent years, power electronic converters have been increasingly used for integration of different generation technologies to electricity networks. However, due to their fast control loops and non-ideal grid conditions, these devices are prone to interact with each other. This can lead to an unstable grid operation with possible catastrophic results. In order to study such interactions between devices before commissioning of new power plants, power hardware in the loop (PHIL) techniques have been increasingly used. However, emulation of complex grid scenarios is not straightforward and requires in-depth knowledge of the emulated grids and dedicated hardware and software. In this paper, the emulation of complex grid scenarios in a PHIL platform is presented. The proposed methodology can be used to emulate not only the dynamics of power devices but also the primary, secondary and tertiary control levels. Four complex scenarios are described and their implementation discussed, with special emphasis on practical details that are commonly not explained in the literature. Results show that the low-frequency dynamics of diesel generators, microgrids, electrical systems and local-power networks can be effectively emulated in the PHIL platform. All the scenarios are validated experimentally. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This research paper presents the case study results on generating electricity based on solar resources for an existing residential building with conventional electric energy demand located in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The solar energy system proposed for analysis has provided the back-up energy through two types of state-of-the-art energy storage technologies: (a) Tesla batteries and (b) hydrogen vector energy, obtained electrolytically on-site. Starting from the main imposed condition that all the building's electric energy demand be provided by the solar resource, sustainable technical solutions for renewable energy storage are of crucial importance for the successful implementation of power systems based on clean solar energy. New solar energy storage technologies are imperative for the superior harnessing of solar resources at the production site, whether it is short-term energy storage such as Tesla batteries or long-term energy storage such as hydrogen energy vector. The main objective of this work is to assess the feasibility of the proposed grid-independent energy system, which is pairing solar power to sustainable energy storage technologies within an existing residential building with conventional electric energy demand. This study aims to evaluate the optimal sizing of the solar units implemented in the design along with the optimal back-up energy storage capacities to fulfil the building's daily electricity demand in an uninterrupted mode. This article investigates the possibility of supplying 100% solar power to the existing residential building with conventional electric energy demand under constraints and limitations conditions due to the stochastic nature of building electricity consumption, volatile and intermittent nature of solar resources, local meteorological conditions specific to the building's placement and space limitations for the positioning of the photovoltaic panels. The average daily load that has been calculated for the building has a value of 6.50 kWh. To reach the proposed target of integral solar power supply, photovoltaic panels with an installed power of 7.84 kWp paired with a Tesla batteries bank with a storage capacity of 7.4 kWh are needed, and in the case of storing solar energy in the form of electrolytic hydrogen it is necessary to pair the photovoltaic panels with an installed power of 15.12 kWp, 3 kW electrolyser, 2 kW fuel cell and H2 tank of 7 kg. The annual energy demand of 2369 kWh is achieved of 43.27% directly from photovoltaic panels and 56.73% through the back-up energy in case of pairing the batteries as an energy storage medium, and in case of pairing hydrogen as an energy vector, 41.53% is powered directly by photovoltaic panels and 58.46% comes from the energy reserve stored through hydrogen technologies. The environmental analysis highlights an average decrease of up to 85% in carbon dioxide emissions generated by the implementation of clean energy systems analysed compared to the grid electricity. Also, the results of this study show that the investment costs in photovoltaic panels and storage systems are still high, limiting their use in residential buildings, but we are witnessing technological developments to improve the performance and durability of these electricity storage solutions at low costs, which will allow them to be marketed on a large scale, particularly widespread for residential applications. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The multiple uncertainties in a microgrid, such as limited photovoltaic generations, ups and downs in the market price, and controlling different loads, are challenging points in managing campus energy with multiple microgrid systems and are a hot topic of research in the current era. Microgrids deployed at multiple campuses can be successfully operated with an exemplary energy management system (EMS) to address these challenges, offering several solutions to minimize the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, maintenance costs, and peak load demands of the microgrid infrastructure. This literature survey presents a comparative analysis of multiple campus microgrids’ energy management at different universities in different locations, and it also studies different approaches to managing their peak demand and achieving the maximum output power for campus microgrids. In this paper, the analysis is also focused on managing and addressing the uncertain nature of renewable energies, considering the storage technologies implemented on various campuses. A comparative analysis was also considered for the energy management of campus microgrids, which were investigated with multiple optimization techniques, simulation tools, and different types of energy storage technologies. Finally, the challenges for future research are highlighted, considering campus microgrids’ importance globally.

	abstract = {The rigidity of information technology (IT) has been hindering the development of various businesses regarding energy management systems (EMSs) of power networks, although this area has become more diversified, resulting in changes of elements in the systems due to the introduction of renewable energy (RE) and the new energy industry. In order to effectively accommodate these changes, EMSs should be developed in a structure with a standard-based interface, which can secure interoperability between components in the EMS. In previous studies, the common information model (CIM) proposed by IEC TC57 has been utilized for developing EMSs of power networks, but there are gaps between the existing CIM and an information model for the EMSs of carbon-free island microgrids (MGs), which are a newly introduced form of power network covering multiple islands for reducing carbon emissions. This paper proposes a CIM-based software platform for a carbon-free island MG-EMS to efficiently operate the power network and secure interoperability between components in the MG-EMS. Concerning service restoration of the power network, use cases and business objects representing information exchanged between the components in the EMS are derived, and the existing CIM is extended based on the results of the gap analysis in order to provide necessary information on the MG-EMS. The validity of the proposed platform is verified by exchanging payloads between components in the MG-EMS based on the profile extracted from the extended CIM. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed platform regarding data size and speed of data exchange is presented. Based on the case study results, it is concluded that the proposed platform based on the extended CIM can exchange data between the components in the MG-EMS, achieving reasonable data size and speed of data exchange with the help of the interoperability between components in the carbon-free island MG-EMS. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {New decentralized energy-generation technologies have turned economies of scale upside down while becoming more economically viable. At the same time, the increased penetration of information technologies has led to new opportunities to manage infrastructure in a less hierarchical, more flexible way. Together with citizen demands for control over energy, these two converging trends has put energy communities (ECs) on the agenda, potentially advancing the transition towards more sustainable energy systems, despite hindrances encountered on the way. This paper presents a case study of the planning process of a sustainable city district in Sweden, using participatory observations and interviews conducted with included stakeholders. We analyse how the included stakeholders has reasoned about establishing a sustainable energy system in the area, including a microgrid. The discussions on a microgrid comprised two parallel discourses, coexisting but seldomly explicitly confronted. The distribution system operator in the area promoted a distributed energy system (DES) solution, while the property developers opted for a microgrid organized more as a citizen energy community (CEC). We discuss why the CEC proponents so far has lost the battle of creating a community owned smart grid. We conclude that the different models, a DES and a CEC, comprise different values and an increased focus on energy communities could shift the transition pathway towards a more decentralized system involving other prioritise than just economical. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The introduction of microgrids has enabled an efficient energy management in the system with installation of renewable energy sources. As one of the representative models of microgrid, various studies on campus microgrids (CMGs) have been conducted. In operation of CMG, various energy consumption resources and renewable energy are considered to minimize overall cost or peak power in the system. However, most of conventional researches only deal with performance analysis in terms of simulation by collecting data from the different environments. In this case, there are lack of consideration in power regulation or electricity cost which make it difficult to apply the researched energy operation technology to the actual power system. To solve the problem, this paper build a test-bed in an actual CMG environment and collect dataset through the various IoT sensors. In addition, uncertainties that occur through the various power resources are analyzed and used to derive net energy consumption scenarios. In this way, we propose a new cost optimal energy management model with the detailed analysis of power generation and consumption using various auxiliary IoT devices. Based on the real-world datasets from the implemented CMG, we show that the proposed analytical models and energy management model are feasible for actual environments. With satisfying the constraints, we show that the daily electricity cost could be reduced up to 2.16% and peak power is reduced up to 3% compared to the case without considering the uncertainties in CMG. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Solar energy is highly dependent on climatic conditions and swings sporadically, making photovoltaic integration into power systems difficult. In order to improve the design of power infrastructure and the successful deployment of decentralized and renewable energy sources, a new paradigm for the energy supply chain is established, leading to the creation of microgrids. Intelligence should be introduced at all levels of the grid, and it should act over a long period. This article introduces new research tools and methodologies to help utility engineers better understand the grid's potential impact from these new power sources. Therefore, this research proposes a novel PV solar system control method. The strategy is an innovative Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) technology for solar systems. Designing an effective controller capable of lowering Power Stress inside the PV System is critical in this respect. In this research, the Proportional Integral (PI) controller has been utilized in conjunction with a heuristic technique termed Genetic Algorithm (GA) in order to regulate and stabilize the MPP of the power supplied by the PV system. Then the GA technique has been utilized to identify the ideal settings, based on the four performance indices of Integrated Squared Error (ISE), Integrated Absolute Error (IAE), Integrated Time Absolute Error (ITAE), and Integrated Time Squared Error (ITSE) (Kp, Ki). The simulation results show that the PV system can successfully monitor the required MPP. © 2022 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. All rights reserved.},

Microgrids have been put forward to address the intermittency of such sources while managing privacy and control complexity. For instance, in Switzerland, the regulatory framework for “self-consuming groups” has been softened as to facilitate the implementation of such solutions. However, the implications of these deployments for entrants and incumbents have not been thoroughly studied. We conducted a Micro-Delphi survey to explore these implications. It unveiled two benchmark business models for microgrids. Incumbent operators could shift to energy services provision through microgrid implementations, benefitting, namely, from efficiency improvements, but they face significant regulatory barriers. Entrants could also provide energy services or directly sell turnkey microgrid products, which face little regulatory barriers but lack exemplary business cases. All respondents underlined the uncertainty in the sector, with active research on business models and technologies making disruptions possible. To anticipate the threat of new entrants, incumbents could shift to a system based on hierarchical smart-grid architectures: besides the technical implementation of such a smart-grid, regulations and markets should be adapted for the coordination of privately-owned microgrids, enhancing the extraction of value propositions for both their owners and the overall system. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {This work presents the development of a decision-making strategy for fulfilling the power and heat demands of small residential neighborhoods. The decision on the optimal operation of a microgrid is based on the model predictive control (MPC) rolling horizon. In the design of the residential microgrid, the new approach different technologies, such as photovoltaic (PV) arrays, micro-combined heat and power (micro-CHP) units, conventional boilers and heat and electricity storage tanks are considered. Moreover, electricity transfer between the microgrid components and the national grid are possible. The MPC problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. The proposed novel approach is applied to two case studies: one without electricity storage, and one integrated microgrid with electricity storage. The results show the benefits of considering the integrated microgrid, as well as the advantage of including electricity storage. © 2022 by the authors.},

This study developed a new concept of a loose-coupled bipolar DC building power system. The concept was used to design a real-world office building in Shenzhen, China. A power system model was developed to study the stability and control of the DC power system and to verify DC power quality. The design and modeling of the DC power control system is discussed in detail. The study developed a few common fault scenarios in DC building microgrids that were simulated in the MATLAB-Simulink environment to validate the design of a loose-coupled bipolar DC system.

	abstract = {The establishment of the concept of sustainable, decentralised, multi-carrier energy systems, together with the declining costs of renewable energy technologies, has proposed changes in off-grid electrification interventions towards the development of integrated energy systems. Notwithstanding the potential benefits, the optimal capacity planning of such systems with multiple energy carriers— electricity, heating, cooling, hydrogen, biogas—is exceedingly complex due to the concurrent goals and interrelated constraints that must be relaxed. To this end, this paper puts forward an innovative new optimal capacity planning method for a first-of-its-kind stand-alone multiple energy carrier microgrid (MECM) serving the electricity, hot water, and transportation fuel demands of remote communities. The proposed off-grid MECM system is equipped with solar photovoltaic panels, wind turbines, a hydrogen-based energy storage system—including an electrolyser, a hydrogen reservoir, and a fuel cell—a hybrid super-capacitor/battery energy storage system, a hot water storage tank, a heat exchanger, an inline electric heater, a hydrogen refuelling station, and some power converters. The main objective of calculating the optimal size of the conceptualised isolated MECM’s components through minimising the associated lifetime costs is fulfilled by a specifically developed meta-heuristic-based solution algorithm subject to a set of operational and planning constraints. To evaluate the utility and effectiveness of the proposed method, as well as the technical feasibility and economic viability of the suggested grid-independent MECM layout, a numerical case study was carried out for Rakiura–Stewart Island, Aotearoa–New Zealand. Notably, the numeric simulation results highlight that the optimal solution presents a low-risk, high-yield investment opportunity, which is able to save the diesel-dependent community a significant 54% in electricity costs (including electrified space heating)—if financed as a community renewable energy project— apart from providing a cost-effective and resilient platform to serve the hot water and transportation fuel needs. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The propagation of hybrid power systems (solar–diesel–battery) has led to the development of new energy management system (EMS) strategies for the effective management of all power generation technologies related to hybrid microgrids. This paper proposes two novel EMS strategies for isolated hybrid microgrids, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses using simulations. The proposed strategies are different from the EMS strategies reported thus far in the literature because the former enable the real-time operation of the hybrid microgrid, which always guarantees the correct operation of a microgrid. The priority EMS strategy works by assigning a priority order, while the optimal EMS strategy is based on an optimization criterion, which is set as the minimum marginal cost in this case. The results have been obtained using MATLAB/Simulink to verify and compare the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, through a dynamic microgrid model to simulate the conditions of a real-time operation. The differences in the EMS strategies as well as their individual strengths and weaknesses, are presented and discussed. The results show that the proposed EMS strategies can manage the system operation under different scenarios and help power system operator obtain the optimal operation schemes of the microgrid. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, we propose a federated DRL-based request scheduling algorithm for distributed microgrid cluster scenarios with the goal of maximizing the long-term utility of the system. In addition, we prune the DRL model to make it more applicable to resource-constrained edge nodes. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has more stable performance and better adaptability to the dynamic system environment compared to the traditional centralized training. In addition, the pruning of the model compresses the size of the model to 50.4% with a 4% loss of accuracy.  © 2022 IEEE.},

However, there is a lack of research on multi-microgrid collaborative integrated operation scheduling, which fails to consider the impact of interactions among multi-microgrid on the multi-microgrid collaborative operation and has not yet conducted systematic research on its implementation mechanism and application scenarios. To address the above problems, this paper constructs a new multi-microgrid system model and proposes a hierarchical control strategy based on the improved greedy algorithm and SOC status value. Compared with the traditional coordination control strategy, this method can realize the pairwise combination among microgrids, effectively and reliably control the power flow, and significantly improve the stability and distributed energy utilization of multi-microgrid. Finally, build a new multi-microgrid model based on Simulink, select typical working scenarios for simulation analysis, and verify the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed control strategy. © 2022 IEEE.},

It demonstrates that existing dc-dc converter technologies do not allow building a universal interface microconverter because of wide dispersion of the parameters. However, the absence of universal microconverters limits the widespread adoption of PV modules despite great benefits for energy-efficient buildings and restrains the deployment of residential PV-based dc microgrids. Based on the design requirements formulated, a new approach utilizing a boost half-bridge front-end inverter and a three-mode reconfigurable rectifier (RR) is proposed. The article describes the operating principle of the derived converter. The RR allows keeping the duty cycle of the input side within a favorable range of acceptable efficiencies. An experimental prototype rated for 360 W was assembled and tested in the entire operating range. The experimental results prove the ultrawide input voltage range of over 1:20 and demonstrate the capability of the proposed concept to interface different PV module types while enabling their shade-tolerant operation.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Following the development of Small Modular Reactors (SMR) to reduce the capital costs and increase the safety of new nuclear power plants, microreactors are being designed by several companies. Microreactors are usually defined as SMR with a power output in the range 1–20 MWe. They can operate as part of the electric grid, independently from the electric grid or as part of a microgrid to produce electricity and process heat. In the present paper, some microreactors at an advanced design stage are presented: eVinci™, Aurora, Holos Generators, Xe-Mobile, NuScale, Sealer, U-Battery and Micro Modular Reactor. The main applications of microreactors and the technology features are then discussed to present the main potentialities and challenges. The main advantages are the small size, the simple plant layout and the fast on-site installation. The main challenges are the limited fuel availability, the security and proliferation risk and the licensing process.

Blockchain use cases are not just confined to crypto currency; it is used in numerous fields including financial services, Internet of Things (IoT) and voting systems. This technology is reshaping the digital world by bringing a new outlook to security, efficiency and stability of systems and databases. This project aims to provide a potential solution of how blockchain facilitates cost reduction when used in microgrids. The energy is transferred from producer to consumer and the additional service charges are eliminated when using the blockchain method. This idea uses a bidding mechanism in the grid so that the producer who gives energy at a minimum cost is automatically mapped to the consumer. The modified model shows an approximate cost reduction (cost for energy consumption) of 24% in our specified use case. The cost is always reduced when using blockchain in any scenario, but the percentage may vary. The smart contract is included in blockchain shared by the participants and keeps immutable transaction records. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While the techno-economic feasibility of Solid State Transformer (SST) is constantly under question, some of the leaders in the power sector have recognised the potential of the technology and have started efforts of commercialisation. One of the important advantages of SST is its ability to integrate the low voltage DC grids technology. The key areas of research in this field is to use the accurate model of SST between two dc grids. In this article, an accurate composite model of SST that incorporates high switching frequency is developed. The model is controlled using a conventional voltage control technique and with a proposed power control technique. Thus developed SST is employed in transferring the power between two ring main dc microgrids (composed with distributed energy resources) using dual active bridge configuration. This article provides detailed insight of power-sharing scheme between two interconnected ring dc microgrids while maintaining its individual bus voltages within prescribed limits with supervisory communication control approach.

	abstract = {With Demand Response (DR) and Distributed Energy Resource (DER) assets' increasing presence at the distribution level, distribution utilities are faced with increasing challenges - ranging from power flow reversals, voltage fluctuations, and phase imbalances, among others. To efficiently manage the impact of these new assets, collectively referred to as Grid-Edge Resources, it is worth examining what underlying grid architecture, systems or solutions would be required. Currently, most distribution grid operators rely on Distribution Management Systems (DMS) and Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS) to gain visibility and the capability to control the grid and grid-connected assets. Now the question arises, should the current grid architecture be maintained and can the technology for DMS/ADMS simply be upgraded and extended to include tools and applications to manage DERs? Or, would a new technology stack involving separate Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS), interfaced with the existing DMS/ADMS, provide the required visibility and control capability to manage the entire grid down to customer-side of the meter and all DERs, while providing DER owners and operators the ability to manage their assets based on incentive signals provided by DERMS? Several factors impact the decision on how to move forward on future grid management architecture. These factors include the fact that most DERs are owned by customers, are located in grid segments beyond DMS/ADMS reach, and may have local Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) and contractual requirements. Another factor is the distribution utilities' traditional separation between Customer Services, where all customer-related data are managed and maintained, and Distribution Operations, where all distribution grid data required for grid operations are managed. Other considerations are the tariff-related rules and requirements for DER participation, and the various capacity, energy and other service provisions required to support grid operations. Complicating the decision is the fact that these tariff rules and requirements are regional, utility-specific, and vary from utility to utility.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The increasing interest in renewable microgrids have motivated the exploration of more sustainable alternatives to traditional energy supply. In this study, a novel hybrid renewable energy-based microgrid power system is proposed, designed and techno-economically assessed. The system consists of a concentrated parabolic solar dish Stirling engine and a horizontal axis wind turbine integrated with a battery bank. The novelty of the study lies in replacing conventional hybrid systems, such as a typical photovoltaic/wind assembly, with a novel solar dish/wind turbine system that has the potential to achieve higher efficiencies and financial competitiveness. The solar dish Stirling engine serves as the primary source of electrical power generation while the horizontal axis wind turbine, in conjunction with a battery bank, supplies backup electricity when the primary source of power is unavailable. The system has been designed through advanced modelling in the MATLAB/ Simulink® environment that efficiently integrates the individual energy technologies. A technical sensitivity analysis has been performed for all the units in order to reduce the respective design limits and identify optimum operational windows. Further, the performance of the model has been tested at two locations in Jordan, and a thorough techno-economic analysis of the integrated system has been conducted. The simulation results show that at the optimal design point the efficiency of the Stirling engine is 37% with a net output power of 1500 kWe. For the horizontal axis wind turbine, a module of 100 kWe with a power coefficient of 0.2–0.24 is suitable for operation in terms of cost, power, torque and farm size. Also, two economic indicators, namely, the levelised cost of electricity and hourly cost, have been calculated. The levelised cost of electricity lies between 0.13 and 0.15 $/kWh while the hourly cost is found to be around 4 $/h. Thus, the economic evaluation revealed that the proposed system is very competitive with other integrated renewable energy technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The inclusion of targets for reducing carbon emissions by governments at the global level requires greater deployment of renewable energy in generation planning, implying further development in electric energy transmission and distribution systems. As a result, there are benefits in the environmental area, but it imposes greater technological development due to the system’s characteristics related to inertia, stability and more unpredictability. The inclusion of power inverters in distributed generation, microgrids and renewable generation, differs from conventional generation. This shows greater predictability when planning protection systems. The behavior of these new generation technologies under fault conditions contains characteristics that differ from those of conventional rotating machines, since the most recent generation interacts with the inverter interface. Causing the inclusion of optimization for how the protection acts in the electric power system. The precise location being determined as well as the fault type imposes more effective system reset time, greater reliability and cost-effectiveness. Several methodologies are used to protect the electrical power system. Therefore, some fault determination methods based on traveling waves in distribution systems are analyzed in this research, as well as the influence of distributed generation with renewable energy in the formation of faults in energy systems, imposing differentials in selectivity when compared to conventional systems of distribution. Fault location methods based on traveling waves are paramount due to their precision and ultra-fast location capability. The extraction of essential information comes from the efficient use of signal processing methods, as traveling wave transients act at high frequency. In future applications for the protection of energy systems consisting of smart grids, microgrids and active distribution systems, protection techniques based on traveling waves demonstrate an enormous potential for technological development. The system acting with standardization implies more reliability for dynamic energy networks. Due to the ideal and imprecise determination of fault in the determination of the electricity distribution network, when the DG (distributed generation) accesses using the traditional BPSO (binary particle swarm optimization) and an IBPSO (binary particle swarm optimization) enters in the process of analysis to determine the location of the fault. First, the establishment of the fault location model, which mainly contains the accurate coding mode, the enhanced switching function and the enhanced tuning function, is performed. So, BPSO gets enhancement, which has the inertial weight in the algorithm with adaptive capability, so that the particle gets better. Fault location with location approximations in DG distribution networks (distributed generation) is defined using traditional BPSO (binary particle swarm optimization), with this, improvements of the location method lead to a more accurate response solving constrained-optimization problems (COPs) linked to research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {With arrival of advanced technologies, automated appliances in residential sector are still in unlimited growth. Therefore, the design of new management schemes becomes necessary to be achieved for the electricity demand in an effort to ensure safety of domestic installations. To this end, the Demand Side Management (DSM) is one of suggested solution which played a significant role in micro-grid and Smart Grid systems. DSM program allows end-users to communicate with the grid operator so they can contribute in making decisions and assist the utilities to reduce the peak power demand through peak periods. This can be done by managing loads in a smart way, while keeping up customer loyalty. Nowadays, several DSM programs are proposed in the literature, almost all of them are focused on the domestic sector energy management system. In this original work, four heuristics optimization algorithms are proposed for energy scheduling in smart home, which are: bat algorithm, grey wolf optimizer, moth flam optimization, algorithm, and Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm. The proposed model used in this experiment is based on two different electricity pricing schemes: Critical-Peak-Price and Real-Time-Price. In addition, two operational time intervals (60 min and 12 min) were considered to evaluate the consumer’s demand and behavior of the suggested scheme. Simulation results show that the suggested model schedules the appliances in an optimal way, resulting in electricity-cost and peaks reductions without compromising users’ comfort. Hence, results confirm the superiority of HHO algorithm in comparison with other optimization techniques. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The intra-hour intermittency of solar energy and demand introduce significant design challenges for microgrids. To avoid costly energy shortfalls and mitigate outage probability, islanded microgrids must be designed with sufficient distributed energy resources (DER) to meet demand and fulfill the energy and power balance. To avoid excessive runtime, current design tools typically only utilize hourly data. As such, the variable nature of solar and demand is often overlooked. Thus, DER designed based on hourly data may result in significant energy shortfalls when deployed in real-world conditions. This research introduces a new, fast method for optimizing DER investments and performing dispatch planning to consider intra-hour variability. A novel set of constraints which operate on intra-hour data are implemented in a mixed-integer-linear-program microgrid investment optimization. Variability is represented by the single worst-case intra-hour fluctuation. This allows for fast optimization times compared to other approaches tested. Applied to a residential microgrid case study with 5-minute intra-hour resolution, this new method is shown to maintain optimality within 2% and reduce runtime by 98.2% compared to full-scale-optimizations which consider every time-step explicitly. Applicable to a variety of technologies and demand types, this method provides a general framework for incorporating intra-hour variability into microgrid design. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV), where people, fleets of electric vehicles (EVs), utility, power grids, distributed renewable energy, and communications and computing infrastructures are con-nected, has emerged as the next big leap in smart grids and city sectors for a sustainable society. Meanwhile, decentralized and complex grid edge faces many challenges for planning, operation, and management of power systems. Therefore, providing a reliable communications infrastructure is vital. The fourth industrial revolution, that is, a cyber-physical system in conjunction with the Internet of Things (IoT) and coexistence of edge (fog) and cloud computing brings new ways of dealing with such challenges and helps maximize the benefits of power grids. From this perspective, as a use case of IoV, we present a cloud-based EV charging framework to tackle issues of high demand in charging stations during peak hours. A price incentive scheme and another scheme, electricity supply expansion, are presented and compared with the baseline. The results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical models improve the system performance and the quality of service (QoS) for EV customers. The proposed methods can efficiently assist system operators in managing the system design and grid stability. Further, to shed light on emerging technologies for smart and connected EVs, we elaborate on seven major trends: decentralized energy trading based on blockchain and distributed ledger technology, behavioral science and behavioral economics, artificial and computational intelligence and its applications, digital twins of IoV, software-defined IoVs, and intelligent EV charging with information-centric networking, and parking lot microgrids and EV-based virtual storage. We have also discussed some of the potential research issues in IoV to further study IoV. The integration of communications, modern power system management, EV control management, and computing technologies for IoV are crucial for grid stability and large-scale EV charging networks. © 2022 by the authors.

EIoT has become a vital role in the energy field. However, a challenge facing the widespread adoption of EIoT is the issue of data leakage caused by nontransparent and untrusted energy market. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, traceability, and no need for a third-party trust mechanism. It can be synergistic and complementary with EIoT to improve its security. This paper aims to study the integration of blockchain and EIoT. We present the typical applications of blockchain in the EIoT field from the three technical dimensions of smart contract, consensus protocol, and cross-chain communication. In addition, we summarize the performance evaluation methods of the blockchain-based EIoT scheme. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges associated with blockchain technology in the field of EIoT, and also presented the state-of-the-art research works addressing these challenges. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Empowered by the emergence of novel information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as sensors and high-performance digital communication systems, Europe has adapted its electricity distribution network into a modern infrastructure known as a smart grid (SG). The benefits of this new infrastructure include precise and real-time capacity for measuring and monitoring the different energy-relevant parameters on the various points of the grid and for the remote operation and optimization of distribution. Furthermore, a new user profile is derived from this novel infrastructure, known as a prosumer (a user that can produce and consume energy to/from the grid), who can benefit from the features derived from applying advanced analytics and semantic technologies in the rich amount of big data generated by the different subsystems. However, this novel, highly interconnected infrastructure also presents some significant drawbacks, like those related to information security (IS). We provide a systematic literature survey of the ICT-empowered environments that comprise SGs and homes, and the application of modern artificial intelligence (AI) related technologies with sensor fusion systems and actuators, ensuring energy efficiency in such systems. Furthermore, we outline the current challenges and outlook for this field. These address new developments on microgrids, and data-driven energy efficiency that leads to better knowledge representation and decision-making for smart homes and SGs. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Photovoltaic power generation becomes an important technology in recent year, because of its advantages such as clean energy, pollution reduction, no gas emissions, maintenance and operation requirements are low. So it is a new path for generating electric power. This paper will study the performance comparison of two photovoltaic systems of three-phase grid-connected micro-inverter and study their design methods of reactive power control. The first design is suggested that the photovoltaic PV system based on an interleaved DC-DC boost type converter with its maximum power point tracking control (MPPT) for each boost converter. A voltage source inverter type (VSI) is used as a three-phase micro-inverter. By controlling the direct and quadrature components of inverter output currents, reactive power controlling is achieved at 90.76% efficiency. The second design is suggested that the photovoltaic panel is connected DC-DC converter of an interleaved flyback type. Each sub-converter is controlled by an individual (MPPT). The circuit of active third-harmonic current injection in recent years have received much interest, this technique contributed to get better quality of current injected into the utility grid and to control the reactive power with good efficiency 95.07%. A line-commutate current source inverter type (CSI) with filter is used. The developed micro-inverter of (1000W) offers an expanded range of reactive power control with balanced three-phase output power. Each system design in this study has proven its effectiveness in obtaining control of reactive power and nearly sinusoidal three-phase output currents. The effectiveness of the suggested systems are clarified by using the MATLAB Simulink program and the results of the simulation show the validity of the suggested micro-inverter system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In recent years, with the rapid development of the battery energy storage industry, its technology has shown the characteristics and trends for large-scale integration and distributed applications with multi-objective collaboration. As a grid-level application, energy management systems (EMS) of a battery energy storage system (BESS) were deployed in real time at utility control centers as an important component of power grid management. Based on the analysis of the development status of a BESS, this paper introduced application scenarios, such as reduction of power output fluctuations, agreement to the output plan at the renewable energy generation side, power grid frequency adjustment, power flow optimization at the power transmission side, and a distributed and mobile energy storage system at the power distribution side.

	abstract = {Integration of renewable energies into the microgrid (MG) operation can potentially lead to some significant benefits, e.g., less transmission expansion planning cost, direct power supply to the AC/DC loads based on its type, lower costs, higher power quality services and enhanced technology. However, the optimal energy management of the system would be more challenging and complicated. To this end, this paper proposes an effective energy management method for optimal managing of the hybrid AC/DC microgrids using advanced machine learning. The proposed method is composed of two main parts for forecasting and scheduling, wherein the former uses the one class support vector for accurate forecasting and the latter uses the heuristic method for optimal unit commitment. To support the renewable energy technology, all power generated by wind and solar units are purchased by the main grid. The optimization algorithm, inspired from improved whale optimization, is used not only for optimal unit scheduling within the hybrid microgrid but also for adjusting the setting parameters of the forecasting model. To this end, in this paper, for the first time, a new machine learning-enable heuristic technique framework has been developed to not only increase the convergence speed of the algorithm, but also enhancement the accuracy of the algorithm. Results on an IEEE test system demonstrate the high efficiency and merit of the proposed algorithm. Indeed, the simulation results in three different scheduling plans (SPs) show that the proposed framework does not only optimize the total operation costs, but also corrects the voltage profile and minimizes the power losses. These differences can highly distinct the proposed technique from the conventional techniques. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Power systems have incorporated many new technologies in recent years and the introduction of energy storage systems and demand response provides additional challenges for their operation and expansion planning. Current distribution networks are complex active networks where many technologies are included, which must be considered and properly represented in expansion planning models. Thus, this paper proposes a robust model to solve the coordinated operation and expansion planning of active distribution networks with multiple microgrids, distributed energy resources (DERs), demand response, and N-1 generation contingency. The objective is to determine the best expansion planning proposals and the optimal daily operation (24-hour representation) for the DERs under the worst realization of uncertainties, using a contingency-constrained approach. Besides, the load is represented by non-controllable, controllable, and deferrable portions. The model is formulated as a tri-level problem that is solved using a two-stage robust optimization approach. The proposed method is illustrated using a modified version of the IEEE 123-bus test system. The results show that the coordinated operation and expansion planning decreases the total cost of the problem and provides more consistent results for demand response and DERs coordination. Simulations show a reduction of 13.8% in the total cost if the daily operation and demand response are represented, and the inclusion of contingencies provides a reduction of 70% in the EENS (expected energy not served) reliability index for the case study. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A key method of reducing energy usage and bills is collaborative demand management of buildings, and smart distribution networks using local renewable energy integrated sources. Emerging technologies such as the IOT (internet of things) can be integrated with grids, allowing bidirectional communication between customers and suppliers, while supporting remote management and monitoring of live energy usage. These systems create opportunities to deal with the distributed aggregation and control of distributed energy resources (DERs). Investigating how DERs are used at residential level in buildings such as smart houses reveal new possibilities relating to how the demand side can be made more efficient. In the long term, reducing energy demand during onpeak hours is a step towards creating a clean energy future. The primary goal of this paper is to observe and investigate how specific DSM strategies minimize energy consumption while maximizing efficiency with the use of new emerging technologies. A software called ETAP is used to analyse the integration of distributed generation such as renewable energy sources (RES) to utilize local power storage. In short, this is useful in providing flexibility to consumers. A PV system was also tested with an individual domestic load using an energy management system. This test examined how appliance energy usage can be reduced and shows why a management system is required to optimally utilize a PV system.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) in modern power systems, system frequency becomes more prone to fluctuation as RESs do not naturally have inertial properties. A conventional energy storage system (ESS) based on a battery has been used to tackle the shortage in system inertia but has low and short-term power support during the disturbance. To address the issues, this paper proposes a new synthetic inertia control (SIC) design with a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) system to mimic the necessary inertia power and damping properties in a short time and thereby regulate the microgrid (µG) frequency during disturbances. In addition, system frequency deviation is reduced by employing the proportional-integral (PI) controller with the proposed SIC system. The efficacy of the proposed SIC system is validated by comparison with the conventional ESS and SMES systems without using the PI controller, under various load/renewable perturbations, nonlinearities, and uncertainties. The simulation results highlight that the proposed system with SMES can efficiently manage several disturbances and high system uncertainty compared to the conventional ESS and SMES systems, without using the PI controller. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Generating electricity near the consumption can provide more flexibility to supply various services to consumers as well as reduce system losses. The limited fossil fuels and air pollution are among the main incentives for the expansion of this technology. One of the perspectives proposed for effective increase in these resources’ involvement is to combine these resources with the objectives of the visibility of the relationship between distributed generation resources and power network, as well as control of these resources more efficiently. One of the methods of combining distributed generation sources is a new concept called micro grid; a topic that is of great importance in this regard is the proper management of distributed generation resources in micro grid aimed to reduce the costs of generating electricity and polluting the environment. The resource management in micro grid is a completely non-linear and top-order problem. In this paper, micro grid optimum programming has been studied considering the capacities available in the electricity market. In order to realize this, as well as reduce pollution and cost simultaneously, NSGAII multi-objective genetic algorithm is used. Studies have been conducted in the form of three scenarios on a sample micro grid consisting of solar, wind, micro turbine, fuel cell and battery resources, considering the uncertainty of load and solar and wind generations. The probabilistic distribution function (PDF) and Roulette Wheel were used to create variables with uncertainty. The first scenario objective was to reduce costs by PSO, GA, and ABC algorithms’ optimization. In the second scenario, pollution was reduced and the studies were repeated using these three algorithms. Finally, in the third scenario, there was a simultaneous reduction in pollution and cost by these three algorithms, taking into account weight coefficients as well as NSGAII algorithm. © 2022 The Authors.

Achieving a profitable and reliable energy configuration that satisfies continuous operation at minimum cost is necessary due to the high cost of renewable energy technologies. This paper offers a sustainable framework and techno-feasibility evaluation of stand-alone hybrid power options for electrification in Persian Gulf Islands, namely, Larak, Failaka, and Lavan. The real-time hourly irradiation, wind speed, and wave velocity are used to explore new patterns in renewable behavior, using cycle charging (CC) and load following (LF) strategies. Integration of CC-controlled 150 kW generator, 349 kW photovoltaic system, 3 hydrokinetic turbines, 1 wind turbine, 316 kWh battery pack, and 287 kW converter in Lavan Island is found as an optimal solution. The followed NPC, COE, and the renewable fraction of the winning solution are estimated to be M0.160$, $0.013 kWh, and 26% higher than LF mode. The CC-based energy systems, on average, consume more fuel than LF-based options and, followingly, have a lower renewable fraction. The COE rises by $0.001/kWh to $0.004/kWh under CC mode and $0.004/kWh to $0.01 kWh under LF control per each 5% increase in SOCmin values. Although the capital cost under LF is $300 k higher than the CC one, the salvage cost of this controller is estimated to be slightly lower than the CC mode. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The traditional energy resources are not able to suffice present requirements. Renewable energy resources, efficient management of the energy, saving distribution cost of energy, and cheaper availability of energy to end-users are some of the crucial issues in energy supply and management today. The distributed- network concept of Blockchain technology is having capability to modernize the energy generation and distribution sector. The energy industry is consistently catalyzed by innovations including rooftop solar, electric vehicles, communication among energy devices, smart metering, and energy cryptocurrency. Distributed ledger technology of Blockchain has more possibilities to expand the efficiencies for utility providers by finding the owners of grid materials. Blockchain offers exclusive solutions for renewable energy supply in addition to origin tracking. Blockchain technology is getting popular in many use cases around the world, which includes new representations with blockchain for energy marketplaces, real-time data management, renewable energy certificates, and moving carbon credits. Combined efforts from technology developers in energy supply fields, academicians, financial institutions, and government sectors to coordinate Blockchain with the energy sector is one of the smartest and spectacular technology innovations in recent times. The blockchain energy schemes are designing peer-to-peer energy markets. A peer-to-peer energy market is a distributed network of people who sell and buy surplus energy from other contributors. These energy markets help the common people by reducing control from traditional wholesale entities. This energy management is usually done with the help of Microgrids, also known as Smartgrids. End users can access prepaid energy, which can be done by easy mobile transactions. Many companies have connected communities to each other for creating Microgrids and visualize a bright future with entirely distributed peer-to-peer grids. The main advantages of Blockchain in the energy segment are cost reduction, environmental sustainability, more security, and transparency for stakeholders with the benefit of not compromising privacy. This work discusses the concept of Blockchain technology in brief, features of the Microgrid or Smartgrid, some useful use cases of energy Blockchain and benefits of application of Blockchain technology to Smartgrid operations in the following sections. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Latesh Malik, Sandhya Arora, Urmila Shrawankar and Vivek Deshpande; individual chapters, the contributors.},

	abstract = {As a new form of energy management, a microgrid has developed rapidly in recent years. In order to ensure the safe, stable and economical operation of a microgrid system, it is important to provide it with reasonable energy scheduling strategy. According to their operating modes, micro-grids can be divided into two categories: grid-connected microgrids and island microgrids. This paper takes the grid-connected microgrids as the object, applies the Simulink simulation technology to build a microgrid system including an external power supply, photovoltaic power generation, energy storage, and load according to the principle of constant power control (PQ control). Based on this simulation system, this microgrid system is combined with the double deep Q network algorithmfirstly. Then it is trained to get an optimization strategy of energy storage control problem, the goal of which is to minimize the 24-hour electricity cost while meeting the voltage deviation of the microgrid, power balance and the constraint of state of charge of the energy storage. Through experimental verification, the rationality of the energy storage strategy is analyzed from a qualitative perspective, and the effectiveness of the method proposed in this paper is demonstrated from a quantitative perspective. © 2021, Power System Technology Press.

	abstract = {For safe and secure operation as well as accident mitigation of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) during normal operation and in case of emergency scenarios, offsite electricity supply is considered as the most preferred and reliable source. The nuclear safety standard used worldwide and those adopted in Slovakia requires that electricity from the grid should be derived to the NPP via two physically independent circuits in order to minimize the likelihood of their simultaneous failure. These circuits shall be also designed to be available in sufficient time following a loss of all options for onsite power supply, to assure that specified acceptable fuel design limits and design conditions of the reactor coolant pressure boundary are not exceeded. To meet these requirements the electric grid has historically evolved along a consistent physical configuration and mode of operation. The current large and centralized grid consists of high voltage power stations generating electric power, subsequently distributed via a network of high-voltage transmission lines and substations, lower voltage distribution lines and substations, and finally through low voltage local distribution lines to supply the electrical loads of the end users. The current fleet of NPPs has been designed, built, licensed, and operated under this traditional configuration of the electric grid. As the modern electric grid evolves incorporating smart grid innovations, distributed resources, renewable energy sources, high speed sensing and controls, microgrids, large-scale energy storage, and other advanced technologies, NPPs must also adapt to these changes. It naturally brings challenges also to the new state-of-the-art reactor technologies, such as GEN IV reactors or small modular reactors, but most importantly to the current fleet of reactors in operation, which has only limited maneuverability. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive literature survey conducted on Smart Grid technologies, renewable energy integration, grid reliability standards, and electric grid regulations and guidance. It summarizes the measures developed worldwide and tries to adopt some of them for the conditions of Slovakia. © 2022 Technical University of Košice.},

	abstract = {The global contribution from buildings toward energy consumption, both residential and commercial, has steadily increased reaching features between 20 and 40% in developing countries and has exceeded the other major sectors: industrial and transportation. In European countries, buildings account for 40% of total energy consumption. Growth in population, increasing demand for building services, and comfort levels, together with the rise in time spent inside buildings due to COVID-19 pandemic, assure the upward trend in energy demand will continue in the future. Market mechanism in the building sector from an urban perspective is essential as reducing building sector emissions will have to be a critical part of any effective global effort to reduce climate risks. This chapter explores how to build the market mechanism in the building sector from an urban perspective. The first section of this chapter overviews the issues when combining different market mechanisms within building sector and energy market-. The second section describes a framework for integrating renewable energy sources, solar water heating, lighting and cooling, centralized air conditioning, and the use of energy-efficient equipment at different component and spatial levels such as each component, a whole building and at a site or district level. The third section covers the methodologies for the market mechanisms in the building sector, while the fourth section addresses a testbed approach for a new modality and procedure of market mechanism in the building sector as a guide for a Blockchain-based community smart and resource wise market mechanism.

This is mainly due to the changes in the power flow, fault current level, difficulty in protection coordination, changes in system topology, and system operating conditions. This paper proposes three new protection algorithms for active distribution networks with large penetration level of inverter-based DERs. These protection algorithms comprise of an adaptive differential protection algorithm, incremental transient energy-based directional protection, and a rate-of-change of current protection. The proposed protection algorithms were tested with a distribution network integrated with wind, solar, diesel generator, and battery storage DERs which are capable of operating in islanded mode forming local microgrids. The distribution system and the proposed protection functions modelled and simulated using the Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS®). The results obtained from tests validate the proposed algorithms; and their capability to correctly detect and timely isolate faults without resulting in nuisance tripping of the DERs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) have a special role in developing several consumers' energy infrastructure and supply in more economical, safer, and sustainable ways. The interaction and mutual relationship between each energy carrier on the reliable performance of other carriers and the high growth of tri-generation technologies in the MG face the optimal performance of such networks with many challenges. Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP)-based MGs are a new generation of MGs that simultaneously provide electrical, thermal, and cooling loads. However, the interaction between these carriers is very influential in CCHP-based MG's operation, which is rarely analyzed. Hence, this paper focuses on the operation of CCHP-based MG coupled with hybrid chiller, multi-energy storage, solar and wind power, etc., under the chance-constrained programming (CCP) approach by considering the mutual relationship between carriers. While modeling consumption and wind and solar energies fluctuations, the proposed approach analyzes the violation of the balance constraint for each carrier and subject it to guarantee the corresponding confidence level. Therefore, the degree of dependence of the system on each carrier and the mutual relationship between carriers are analyzed in this work. This paper also presents a new incentive framework for participating in the electricity and heating markets for the system. The proposed model is implemented on the test system, and the results are discussed for different cases for several confidence levels. The results illustrate the importance of the electricity carrier confidence level on the safe performance of the whole system compared to other carriers. Only by increasing the operation cost of the electricity sector by 4.3%, the system's reliable performance is guaranteed with a probability of 98%. © 2021},

	abstract = {The energy network is experiencing a decentralizing process due to the recent inclusion of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as photovoltaics (PV), electric vehicles (EV), or batteries. This paradigmatic shift involves new challenges that require enhancing the electricity system's flexibility while preserving its integrity and stability. One way of dealing with them is by unbundling the electrical network into smaller, more manageable units, known as microgrids (MG). Nonetheless, the usage of distributed architectures leads to more exchanged data and control information between end agents, involving security or privacy issues. In this context, blockchain technology emerges as a feasible solution that promises transparent, tamper-proof, and safe systems in a decentralized ecosystem. This paper proposes a distributed energy management platform that takes full advantage of the blockchain technology to enable safe peer to peer (P2P) transactions. A Distributed model predictive control (DMPC) scheme is adopted, and its performance is compared with the centralized approach.  © 2022 EUCA.},

Diversity of electricity generation technologies, application of renewable energy resources, and advancements in energy storage technologies have granted more flexibility to integrate microgrids in rural areas. An appropriate microgrid with a suitable generation storage system can be designed on the basis of the geographical specifications of the rural area and the availability of the system components in the region. However, owing to the high cost of the new technologies, the optimal planning of residential microgrids has attracted more attention. Optimal planning or design of microgrids is accomplished to achieve the minimum price with the highest reliability and lowest environmental emission. In this chapter the projection of residential microgrids is discussed. The system structure and relevant components are introduced. The residential microgrid's optimal planning procedure with required input data, objective functions, and design constraints are explained. The application of HOMER software as powerful software for optimal residential microgrids is presented. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

For the stable operation of an LVDC microgrid, it is necessary to develop a protection method. In this paper, the new protection scheme considering the fault section is proposed using wavelet transform (WT) in an LVDC microgrid. The fault sections are classified into DC side of the alternating current (AC)/DC converter, DC/DC converter connected to photovoltaic (PV) system, DC line, and DC bus. The characteristics of fault current at each fault section are analyzed. Based on these analyses, the new protection scheme including the fault section estimation is proposed using WT. The proposed scheme estimates the fault section using the detail component after performing WT and sends the trip signal to each circuit breaker according to the fault section. The proposed protection scheme is verified through various simulations according to the fault region and fault current using electromagnetic transient program (EMTP)/ATPDraw and MATLAB. The simulation results show that the fault section is accurately determined, and the corresponding circuit breaker (CB) operations are performed. © 2022 by the author.

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new operation management scheme (OMS) for next-day complex power scheduling in an islanded reconfigurable microgrid. Energy supply in the microgrid comes from wind turbines and photovoltaic generators as renewable dispersed generators (RDG). Meanwhile, there are two microturbine units and a fuel cell unit as dispatchable distributed generators (DDG). Also, a battery bank energy storage system (BESS) is integrated. The microgrid has a number of controllable tie-switches to change the microgrid configuration and supplies residential, commercial, and industrial loads with different electrical models. Some of loads participate in a demand control program. The OMS is mathematically formulated as a multi-period mixed-integer stochastic nonlinear optimization. It has to decide the hourly power share of each DDG, the states of the control switches, and specifications of demand response. The OMS aims to minimize the total operation cost, unmet load, and curtailed renewable power maintaining all technical constraints. The uncertainty of renewable resources and load is analyzed in the OMS by Monte-Carlo simulation while scenario-reduction approach is used to reduce the computational burden. Besides, a new version of bat algorithm (IBA) is developed as a robust optimization solver. Simulation results and comparative evaluation of the OMS are presented using a 45-bus case study system to prove the merits of the method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Reducing carbon emissions and electricity costs in industry is a major challenge to ensure competitiveness and compliance with new climate policies. Photovoltaic power offers a promising solution but also brings considerable uncertainties and risks that may endanger the continuity and quality of supply. From an operational point of view, large-scale integration of solar power could result in unmet demand, electrical instabilities and equipment damage. The performance and lifetime of conventional fossil equipment are likely to be altered by repeated transient operations, making it necessary to adopt specific modeling tools. Control strategies and sizing methodologies must be adapted to account for the strong reliability constraint while dealing with significant production uncertainties. In addition, conventional mitigation technologies, such as storage and load flexibility, have limited potential in these applications and may result in high investments or penalties if they are not properly assessed. This study provides an overview of these challenges by providing a transversal analysis of the scientific literature from fossil engine thermodynamics to control system theory applied to industrial systems. The main characteristics of reliability-constrained microgrids are identified and a conceptual definition is proposed by analyzing state-of-the art studies of various industrial applications and taking oil-and gas microgrids as an enlightening example. Then follows a review of the challenges of accounting for dynamical behavior of fossil equipment, PV and storage systems, ending with the identification of several research gaps. Finally, applicable control strategies are presented. © 2021},

As building blocks of smart grids, microgrids are anticipated to become an indispensable component in this transition. In view of this, this paper proposes a new power flow management strategy for interconnected smart microgrids in a distribution network. The developed approach aims at utilizing the spatiotemporal diversity in resource availability and consumer demands in geo-distributed microgrids through optimal power sharing among them, thus lessening the 'brown' energy purchases from the grid. At the lower level, microgrids are modelled as autonomous units with individual objectives while at the upper level, the concept of cooperative game-theory using Nash bargaining solution is applied to coordinate power flows among the participating microgrids. Finally, we highlight the implications of the proposed power flow management strategy through several simulation studies on the modified IEEE 33-bus distribution system with five microgrids. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {By growing interest in hydrogen vehicles (HVs), hydrogen fueling stations (HFSs) that convert electric power to hydrogen to supply HVs have emerged as a new asset for power grids. To safely and consistently supply HFSs with power, the use of microgrids (MGs), including various flexible generation units, is considered to be a reliable choice. This paper proposes a competence MG scheduling model. In this model, an optimal coordination of HFSs with demand response (DR), energy storage systems (ESS), and appropriate multi-market mechanisms is addressed. Also, a reformulated version of a risk-constrained stochastic scheduling (RSS) model is used to minimize the MG operation cost. The uncertainties associated with the real-time market price, renewables, electrical loads, and HVs are handled by considering conservativeness parameters. In this model, linearized AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) equations are included in the mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem to satisfy the security of MG operation. The proposed model is examined on a 21-bus MG while considering various case studies. The results show that the operation of HFSs provides a profit of 254.5$/day by selling hydrogen for MG operator. In addition, it is found that developing the HFS technology can reduce the total daily operation costs of MG by up to 9.6%. It is also shown that participation of MG in both day-ahead and real-time markets leads to a reduction of 11.7% in the operating costs. Moreover, we show that employing DR programs leads to operation cost reduction and load flattening during high-demand hours. The security constraints keep the voltage between 0.97 p.u. and 1 p.u and the loss of lines within a reasonable range.

	abstract = {As reported in the “Clean energy for all Europeans package” set by the EU, a sustainable transition from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy is necessary to improve the quality of life of citizens and the livability in cities. The exploitation of renewable sources, the improvement of energy performance in buildings and the need for cutting-edge national energy and climate plans represent important and urgent topics to be faced in order to implement the sustainability concept in urban areas. In addition, the spread of polygeneration microgrids and the recent development of energy communities enable a massive installation of renewable power plants, high-performance small-size cogeneration units, and electrical storage systems; moreover, properly designed local energy production systems make it possible to optimize the exploitation of green energy sources and reduce both energy supply costs and emissions. In the present paper, a set of key performance indicators is introduced in order to evaluate and compare different energy communities both from a technical and environmental point of view. The proposed methodology was used in order to assess and compare two sites characterized by the presence of sustainable energy infrastructures: the Savona Campus of the University of Genoa in Italy, where a polygeneration microgrid has been in operation since 2014 and new technologies will be installed in the near future, and the SPEED2030 District, an urban area near the Campus where renewable energy power plants (solar and wind), cogeneration units fed by hydrogen and storage systems are planned to be installed. © 2021 by the authors.

This study aims to delve into electrical microgrids based on renewable energies applied in industrial facilities through a review of the literature associated with the study of general microgrids. It later focuses on the relationships between renewable energies and industrial environments.

	abstract = {U.S. cities are typically “policy-takers,” operating within a narrow range of possibilities for housing, transportation, education, health, and energy policy as defined by states and the federal government. Cities’ energy use is bound to a large network of interlocking infrastructure, market, and policy systems—all of these cities have limited capacity and ability to directly influence. Despite these governance limitations on local energy control, the past decade has brought remarkable technological innovations that are set to disrupt the status quo, creating opportunities for cities to become powerful platforms for emerging clean energy systems. The generation, movement, and sale of energy is becoming increasingly decentralized. Whereas cities are already playing a powerful role in shaping local adaptation to climate impacts, the decentralization of energy will increasingly allow cities to play a pivotal role in emission mitigation as well. Thanks to distributed generation, battery storage, smart metering, microgrids, load aggregation, and electrification, cities are beginning to look like “prosumers”—both producing and consuming electricity depending on the time and day. This new autonomy will allow cities to leverage local policies targeting improved efficiency and circularity, decarbonization, renewable fuels, and offsets, thereby furthering a just and efficient energy transition. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Cities are complex systems that face continuous change of environmental, developmental, and political conditions. This dynamic complexity calls into question traditional urban planning and design principles and demands new approaches that can be accomplished using new technologies such as artificial intelligence and specifically machine learning. This need is particularly acute when addressing energy-related issues that are affected by environmental conditions complicated by climate change. Reaching the goal of energy efficient and resilient cities requires moving past building-scale analysis to address the phenomenon at an urban scale. A strategy for reaching energy independency in urban environments has been the development of communities that guarantee the local supply and demand for clean energy, considering both network and building configurations. However, while the spatial development process requires the participation of architects and urban planners, the relationship between urban form and energy performance has not been widely explored in the design of high-performance energy communities, defined herein as minimizing energy demand and exercising the potential for energy self-sufficiency. This may be due to the complexity associated with studying how urban form impacts energy performance and the unavailability of tools for designing and assessing energy performance at this scale. In this study, the use of artificial neural networks is described as a method to unravel the complex, intertwined relationship between urban form and energy demand in communities in the context of San Diego, California, USA. The statistical results of this procedure are interpreted in terms of their architectural implications toward adding a spatial dimension to the existing technical discourse on developing energy-independent communities. The architectural interpretation is then translated into general rules and principles for spatially designing communities in San Diego that would maximize the energy performance of their underlying solar microgrid. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, countries worldwide are transforming their energy systems with higher shares of renewable energy and smart technologies for demand response. Microgrids play an essential role in the transformation of electric grids to smart grids. However, renewable sources present new challenges, particularly those of high variability, which creates uncertainties in the supply side that can affect the security of electricity access at affordable prices. This paper proposes a novel Stackelberg stochastic model to account for different sources of uncertainty. The Stackelberg model considers microgrids as leaders (upper-level problem) with uncertainty regarding the availability of wind and solar sources and electricity prices. Availability of renewable sources is modeled via chance constraints, which allows assessing the risk of microgrids over-committing supply levels. Uncertainty in electricity prices is modeled via a set of demand scenarios with a given probability distribution. The lower-level problem of the Stackelberg problem considers an electricity dispatch problem for each demand scenario. The proposed model allows measuring the strategic actions of microgrids when facing different types of uncertainties and how the smart grid should adapt to guarantee that demand levels are supplied. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. We find that microgrids risk levels above 30% do not correlate with further benefits, such as reduced electricity prices. We also identified that in average, depending on the social cost of carbon and demand level, microgrids can cover their own demand and supply 15% of the electricity demand in the grid. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

It is important to promote the production and consumption of renewable energy and improve the operational reliability of alternating current or direct current AC/DC hybrid power grids.

	abstract = {Currently, the technology associated with charging stations for electric vehicles (EV) needs to be studied and improved to further encourage its implementation. This paper presents a new energy management system (EMS) based on a Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) algorithm for a hybrid EV charging station with a configuration that integrates Z-source converters (ZSC) into medium voltage direct current (MVDC) grids. The EMS uses the evolutionary BBO algorithm to optimize a fitness function defining the equivalent hydrogen consumption/generation. The charging station consists of a photovoltaic (PV) system, a local grid connection, two fast charging units and two energy storage systems (ESS), a battery energy storage (BES) and a complete hydrogen system with fuel cell (FC), electrolyzer (LZ) and hydrogen tank. Through the use of the BBO algorithm, the EMS manages the energy flow among the components to keep the power balance in the system, reducing the equivalent hydrogen consumption and optimizing the equivalent hydrogen generation. The EMS and the configuration of the charging station based on ZSCs are the main contributions of the paper. The behaviour of the EMS is demonstrated with three EV connected to the charging station under different conditions of sun irradiance. In addition, the proposed EMS is compared with a simpler EMS for the optimal management of ESS in hybrid configurations. The simulation results show that the proposed EMS achieves a notable improvement in the equivalent hydrogen consumption/generation with respect to the simpler EMS. Thanks to the proposed configuration, the output voltage of the components can be upgraded to MVDC, while reducing the number of power converters compared with other configurations without ZSC. © 2021 The Author(s)},

A new energy ecosystem is taking shape. The uncertainty of wind energy and load can not be ignored, and effective measures must be taken to ensure the safety of the energy system. In this paper, based on the chance-constrained Gaussian mixture model, the uncertainty set of wind power forecasting error and the uncertainty set of load forecasting error are constructed. The robust economic multi-objective dispatching model is established by incorporating the robustness into the collaborative optimization objective to obtain the robust economic dispatching optimization scheme with higher comprehensive satisfaction. The research in this paper can provide scientific guidance for the robust economic dispatch of cogeneration microgrids with solar thermal power plants, and also provide new ideas for increasing the consumption of clean energy.

	abstract = {Grid-tied power electronic converters are key enabling technologies for interfacing renewable energy sources, energy storage, electrical vehicles, microgrids, and high-voltage dc transmission lines with the electrical power grid. As the number of power converters in modern grids continually increases, their monitoring and coordinated control in a way to support the grid have become topics of increased practical and research interest. In connection with this, latest standards have also defined a mandatory set of control parameters for grid-tied converters, which should be adjustable by a remote entity that sends commands through a communication network. While such a remote control capability allows many new control functions in grid-tied converters, it also renders them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. The aim of this article is first to shed light on the portions of the power converter control systems that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Next, typical cyber-attacks are overviewed by considering different applications of the grid-tied converters. Further, the impact of different types of cyber-attacks on grid support functions is studied. Finally, this article is concluded with summary and recommendation for further research.  © 2020 IEEE.},

Trends and challenges are addressed for the area of study and an embracing overview of the main technologies and techniques is presented for future investigation. As there are many power electronics devices available for employment, in each one of these crucial, modern, sustainable electrical systems, it is important for students, researchers and professionals to understand and compare the state of the art of them all, for the right choice in their respective uses. These apparatuses not only allow grid matching, but also provide new functions that enhance these artifacts’ operations, and of the entire power system. Thus, in this paper, the relationship between power electronics and distributed generation is detailed, with the role and classification of each static converter for the improved operation of wind power, photovoltaic systems, fuel cells, small hydro and microturbines exposed. While the first two are more widely covered in the literature, the last three are rarely discussed and differentiated, in terms of their power electronics interfaces. Then, the same is made for microgrids and smart grids, also scarcely approached in other works, with regard to the characteristics of the power converters applied, confirming their superior performances with the use of power electronics.

	abstract = {Nowadays, the main grid is facing several challenges related to the integration of renewable energy resources, deployment of grid-level energy storage devices, deployment of new usages such as the electric vehicle, massive usage of power electronic devices at different electric grid stages and the inter-connection with microgrids and prosumers. To deal with these challenges, the concept of a smart, fault-tolerant, and self-healing power grid has emerged in the last few decades to move towards a more resilient and efficient global electrical network. The smart grid concept implies a bi-directional flow of power and information between all key energy players and requires smart information technologies, smart sensors, and low-latency communication devices. Moreover, with the increasing constraints, the power grid is subjected to several disturbances, which can evolve to a fault and, in some rare circumstances, to catastrophic failure. These disturbances include wiring issues, grounding, switching transients, load variations, and harmonics generation. These aspects justify the need for real-time condition monitoring of the power grid and its subsystems and the implementation of predictive maintenance tools. Hence, researchers in industry and academia are developing and implementing power systems monitoring approaches allowing pervasive and effective communication, fault diagnosis, disturbance classification and root cause identification. Specifically, a focus is placed on power quality monitoring using advanced signal processing and machine learning approaches for disturbances characterization. Even though this review paper is not exhaustive, it can be considered as a valuable guide for researchers and engineers who are interested in signal processing approaches and machine learning techniques for power system monitoring and grid-disturbance classification purposes. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Integration of renewable energy sources in the form of microgrids can increase the resilience of power systems and decrease their carbon footprints. However, renewable energy sources are intermittent in nature, and their availability can vary significantly with weather and the seasons. Energy storage can be used to make up for the resulting imbalance between supply and demand to a certain degree, but installing large-scale storage for this purpose can be uneconomical. Hence, other types of power sources are often still required, and in many systems this power is provided by diesel generators. The emerging small modular reactor (SMR) technologies can potentially replace these sources with cleaner options. These new reactors feature passive safety systems, long refueling intervals, and have provisions for load-following, allowing them to complement the renewable sources and provide a reliable, dispatchable, low-carbon solution for both electricity generation and district/process heat production. Key issues and approaches are examined and existing works are reviewed to show how SMRs can be integrated into microgrids effectively as a clean and sustainable energy supply. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Applying the technical advantages of blockchain technology to this complex system to manage peer-to-peer energy sharing, transmission, data storage and build smart contracts between network participants can develop an optimal consensus mechanism within the new power grid.

However, microgrid operation brings new challenges, especially in islanded operation as frequency and voltage control are no longer provided by large rotating machines. Instead, the power converters in the microgrid must coordinate to regulate the frequency and voltage and ensure stability. We consider the problem of designing controllers to achieve these objectives. Using passivity theory to derive decentralized stability conditions for the microgrid, we propose a control design method for grid-forming inverters. For the analysis we use higher-order models for the inverters and also advanced dynamic models for the lines with an arbitrarily large number of states. By satisfying the decentralized condition formulated, plug-and-play operation can be achieved with guaranteed stability, and performance can also be improved by incorporating this condition as a constraint in corresponding optimization problems formulated. In addition, our control design can improve the power sharing properties of the microgrid compared to previous non-droop approaches. Finally, realistic simulations confirm that the controller design improves the stability and performance of the power network. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

In the conventional one, the communication was unilateral. However, in a Smart Electric Grid platform, all system members, from different generating units to different consumers, can communicate bilaterally in real-time via modern technologies. At the same time, the new Smart Electric Grid has some challenges. There might be a chance for personal information leakage, cyber-attack, and managing small customers or prosumers are the few crucial challenges in Smart Grid. Introducing Blockchain technology to the Smart Electric Grid is an attractive solution to the problems mentioned earlier. The Blockchain platform comprises cryptographic security measures, a decentralized consensus mechanism, and a distributed ledger. In the present work, protection schemes of the DC microgrids based upon Blockchain technology are discussed in detail. Compared with AC microgrids, DC microgrids provide more efficiency and are more suited for Renewable energy sources. It is due to the reduction in conversion stages and the lack of skin effect. The differential protection scheme along with a backup Blockchain system for DC microgrid is proposed. Detection and isolation of fault with and without cyber-attack are explained with simulation results. Differential protection schemes detect and isolate the high impedance faults, and the Blockchain backup system enhances the trustworthiness of the proposed scheme by mitigating the communication failure impact. © 2022 River Publishers.},

	abstract = {Microgrids, gaining traction from rising distributed generation for carbon reduction, demand novel solutions to regulate on-and off-grid operations, as well as both energy and monetary transfers between the microgrid and the central grid and among different microgrid participants. This research aims to develop and validate an intelligent microgrid management system to secure the competitiveness of Singapore's energy market, by leveraging the inherent synergy between two emerging technologies, i.e., blockchain for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) solar power trading and fog computing for grid infrastructure management. For this vision, we have developed FogChain, an integrative, cost-effective, and scalable microgrid operating system (MGOS), consisting of three technical service layers: 1) a novel microgrid information infrastructure based on the fog-computing paradigm (i.e., intelligence on edge); 2) a blockchain-based microgrid service layer, providing smart contract and decentralized control capabilities for grid application development; and 3) a microgrid application layer (i.e., P2P energy trading) over the blockchain-based grid service. This MGOS would fundamentally transform how solar power is traded among participating electricity prosumers, leading to potentially new operational and business models. We have implemented the FogChain system and conducted extensive experiments to verify its performance advantages.

	abstract = {Recently, interconnected (networked) hybrid AC-DC microgrids have been attracted lots of attentions due to both technical and economic advantages, compared to the conventional interconnected microgrids. In such a system, the DC sources, e.g., solar energies, are connected to the DC busses, while the AC sources, e.g., wind turbines, are connected to the AC busses. Hence, the entire efficiency of the system can be increased significantly. Also, it is more economical than the conventional grids due to removing power electronics interfaces that convert DC to AC power. Although there exist many advantages associated with such a system, there exist many challenges as well. For instance, the energy management of the system, from the system level perspective is more challenging since any changes in any subsystem (AC or DC parts) can potentially affect the energy management of the entire system. To this end, in this paper, a new modified sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is developed to find the optimal solution. Moreover, to increase the security of the power trading within the hybrid AC-DC networked microgrids, the blockchain technology is used and adopted. To make a realistic model, a stochastic load flow, based on copula mode has also been employed. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed blockchain-based hybrid networked AC-DC microgrid energy management framework. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In recent years, multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) have emerged as an invaluable framework for enabling the use of clean and efficient electro-thermal resources as well as the integration of multi-energy storage facilities. Uncertainties modelling in such systems is a challenge because of the heterogeneity of the resources and consumers involved. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a hybrid robust energy management tool for MEMGs encompassing electric, heat, hydrogen and gas sub-networks. The variety of uncertainties brought by unpredictable demand and renewable generation are managed using adequate techniques. This way, renewable generation is modelled using the Hong 2m + 1 approach, the electrical and heat demands are managed using the information gap decision theory and the fuel-cell electric vehicles refueling demand is modelled via scenarios. The novel methodology is validated on a benchmark case study, in which extensive simulations are performed. The obtained results demonstrate the accurateness of the novel proposal and its effectiveness to manage a wide variety of uncertainties. The evidence for accurateness is that the difference in the objective function with the Monte Carlo and Hong 2m + 1 uncertainty modelling approaches only differs by ∼0.2%. Moreover, the new proposal is computationally competitive with the Monte Carlo simulation, improving its computation time by 2–3 times. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Over last few years, increasing penetration of renewables in the distribution networks at consumer level raises concerns on protection, control, stability and reliability. Considering the DG integration and wide variations in operating conditions of the microgrid, relays experience protection issues at fault current level violating important tripping decision rules. This study reviews the impact of DG penetration as integration means on traditional overcurrent (OC) protection schemes, being the most common and widely used relaying scheme in radial distribution networks. This paper reviews the most representative methods with respect to various challenges uncovered by exhaustive studies and validations and reported in the literature. Further, potential adaptive and intelligent schemes are also discussed for enhancing the performance over traditional protection schemes in microgrids. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {New entities and ways of operating electrical power systems have emerged. An example of this is the microgrid (MG), which can be described as a set of power generation units, energy storage systems (ESSs) and demands that can operate as a single set, in order to optimize their energy resources. Moreover, the recent growth in the use of electric vehicles (EVs) in transportation systems has created new challenges to electrical power systems. This article proposes a two-stage stochastic energy scheduling model for an MG to set up the day-ahead optimal decision in the first stage. Real-time operations, depending on wind and photovoltaic solar power, baseload demand and EV demand variability, are taken into account in the second stage. The proposed model considers conventional generators and alternating current (AC) linearized power flow constraints. Besides, a detailed ESS operation is considered, including degradation costs, and nonlinear charging/discharging as well as efficiency variation dependent of state of charge (SOC), for lead-acid and lithium-ion technologies. EV demand behavior is generated by probability-based algorithms that use the Monte Carlo method to perform their simulations, which are based on data of initial SOC, plugin/out times, type of EVs, and chargers. Finally, the proposed model is successfully validated with an IEEE-37 bus system. The results support the superiority of the proposed model over existing works, showing significant variations in battery bank (BB) operation. The computational time is similar to previous works, despite adding new constraints that increase the complexity.  © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the development of energy storage technology and sharing economy, the mode of the sharing energy storage station will become a new form of the energy storage application on the customer-side in the future. A bi-level optimal configuration method for combined cooling, heating and power multi-microgrids based on energy storage station service is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new type of the sharing energy storage mode for energy storage station service was presented, and the operation mode and profit mechanism of the public energy storage station were analyzed. Secondly, the energy storage station service was applied to the combined cooling, heating and power multi-microgrids, and a bi-level programming model considering two different time scales was established: The upper layer model solved the optimal capacity allocation problem of the energy storage station in the long time scale; The lower layer model solved the optimization operation problem of the combined cooling heating and power multi-microgrids in the short time scale. Thirdly, according to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucher (KKT) condition in the lower layer model, the lower layer model was converted and added into the constraints of the upper layer model, and the nonlinear problem was linearized by the Big-M method. Finally, the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed bi-level programming model were demonstrated through the analysis of the three scenarios. It proves that the proposed sharing energy storage station service can effectively reduce the cost of customers, save energy storage resources and realize the mutual benefit and win-win situation between the customers and the energy storage station operator. © 2021, Power System Technology Press.

To leverage ICT in the existing electrical power network, 5G wireless systems are integrated toward the development of smart grid networks. For reliable, efficient, and secure communication infrastructure in a smarter electricity network, the non-orthogonal asynchronous transmission is essential. Besides, a massive number of smart meters (SMs) measure energy consumption and convey instantaneous information to the utility through communications networks. However, data rates beyond 10 Gbps, connectivity to support 1 million per sq km device density, and sub-millisecond latencies are challenging issues when implementing a smart distribution grid. Therefore, this paper presents the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme and optimized power control strategy for smart microgrids to integrate numerous sensor devices with higher data transfer rates and lower latencies. This new microgrid configuration enables multiple electricity users to transmit and receive data simultaneously using the same frequency and enables optimized power flow with high flexibility. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Electrification of the energy systems and the current policies for sustainable development are increasing the potential for distributed energy resources (DERs). Within this trend, electricity grid generation and intermediary elements (e.g. batteries) are distributed, promoting a new business model where the consumers have become prosumers. That is to say, they can both generate and consume energy. The distributed energy generation is based on renewable (mainly, photovoltaics) and storage (i.e. batteries). However, the produced energy is unpredictable without forecasting tools and intermittent (i.e. dependent on the solar resources). Additionally, although the priority is the usage of this energy for self-consumption, the surplus of energy is usually sold to the DSO (Distribution System Operator). Then, the usage of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading fosters new business models and novel paradigms of energy system generation where people can generate their own energy and share it locally with each other. The aforementioned factors have encouraged a wider adoption of microgrids powered by renewable distributed energy sources and they provide a lot of economic and environmental benefits. For that end, this paper presents a P2P approach, combined with demand and production forecasting, to enable novel prosumers’ business models and promoting renewable energy communities for energy transition. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Residential dc microgrids and nanogrids are the emerging technology that is aimed to promote the transition to energy-efficient buildings and provide simple, highly flexible integration of renewables, storages, and loads. At the same time, the mass acceptance of dc buildings is slowed down by the relative immaturity of the dc technology, lack of standardization and general awareness about its potential. Additional efforts from multiple directions are necessary to promote this technology and increase its market attractiveness. In the near-term, it is highly likely that the dc buildings will be connected to the conventional ac distribution grid by a front-end ac-dc converter that provides all the necessary protection and desired functionality. At the same time, the corresponding requirements for this converter have not been yet consolidated. To address this, present paper focuses on various aspects of the integration of dc buildings and includes analysis of related standards, directives, operational and compatibility requirements as well as classification of voltage levels. In addition, power converter configurations and modulation methods are analyzed and compared. A classification of topologies that can provide the required functionality for the application is proposed. Finally, future trends and remaining challenges pointed out to motivate new contributions to this topic.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When the microgrid is switched off the grid connection, the pre-synchronization control link is added reasonably.The amplitude of the two can be achieved more consistent before the grid connection, so as to reduce the adverse effects of switching from the grid connection mode, and achieve the similar effect of seamless switching.This paper first models the microgrid and the virtual synchronous machine control system, then builds the traditional pre-synchronous module, analyzes its shortcomings, and proposes a pre-synchronous control strategy without phase-locking loop. Simulation results show that the new control strategy can make the amplitude and phase of VSG output voltage follow the grid voltage at the time point before the grid connection. After comparing the results, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy are proved.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microgrids are changing the traditional approach of addressing energy demands in a variety of communities and businesses. They open up new paths to a carbon-free, dependable, and resilient electric system. DC Microgrids are becoming more prevalent as power electronic converter technology advances. Today and in the future, higher fuel prices, deregulation, and environmental constraints present more opportunities for the use of renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems. A micro grid idea is necessary to integrate renewable energy sources into the electrical system. As a result, this proposed system has a micro grid control mechanism involving solar (PV), battery energy storage systems (BESS)and wind. To begin, voltage control alternatives for an island micro grid are investigated using hierarchical control approaches. Furthermore, the cost and electricity generated by renewable sources are calculated. Finally, this study presents an energy management system for micro grid functioning. In grid-connected mode, MATLAB and Arduino programming are used to find the lowest cost of electricity generation and power availability. The simulation results indicate that the suggested solutions are close to being accurate and efficient. The corresponding hardware model has been implemented. © Grenze Scientific Society, 2022.},

	abstract = {There is a rapid increase in power demand which has led to an increase in the need for smaller grids all over the world. The microgrid is such a small power supply system that consists of loads, distributed energy resources, and energy storage systems. With the development of the internet, the power sector has started the development of the newest type of grids, involving a smart technology called smart grids. Smart grids have got smart integration and advanced storage, along with dynamic optimization of grid operation and resources, digital information and control, distributed resources, demand-side resources, energy efficiency resources, and smart metering systems. The developments in intelligent controllers reflect in power flow management also. This paper gives an idea of how to achieve power flow management through a tariff-based Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The control algorithm used here is the k factor-based Icosϕ algorithm, which decides the amount of power shared by microgrids and the grid based on the load demand. The power forecasting of the microgrid with a solar source is performed using ANN. The regression plot and the error histogram obtained show the accuracy of the ANN controller. The simulation of power flow management of the smart microgrid system is tested and analyzed and the proposed system is compared with other existing research. The hardware implementation of the FLC controller with the Arduino interface which is analogous to real-time measurement is explained in detail to compare the simulation results obtained. © 2022 IETE.},

	abstract = {ThePhotovoltaicsystem(PV) systems are reliable Renewable Energy Sources (RES) because to their efficiency under high irradiation conditions, low maintenance, and low pollution. Effective processes generate steady power. This new programme determines the dynamic performance of this technology's application to conduct a thorough feasibility utility grid is determined under different operational circumstances. However, integrating renewable energy into the alternating current system has challenges including voltage increases, synchronisation, and protection. With the DCDC converter, the power distribution system will be more reliable. The RES voltage level and storage needed by the static power DCDC converter must be maintained to preserve grid synchronisation. Because static converters are simple, they need a separate converter for stabilisation, increasing the circuit size. Compact size, centralised control, and energyefficient energy management are important features of Multiport Converters (MPC). The microgrid needs a backup battery to offset the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. To ensure safety, isolation between the source and the load is required. Storage devices need a twoway power channel. An independent multiport converter is needed for the connected operation of the battery equipment and the utilisation of various renewable energy sources. The benefits of higher power density and separation of the nonisolation circuit allow for a smaller total circuit size.

	abstract = {Microgrids (MD) is a new technology to improve efficiency, resilience, and reliability in the electricity sector. MD are most likely to have a clean energy generation, but the increase of microgrids with this kind of generation brings new challenges for energy management (EMS), especially concerning load uncertainties and variation of energy generation. In this context, this study has the main objective to propose a method of how to attend this matter, verifying the difference between the day before and real-time. The EMS proposed analyses the MD in real-time, calculating the deviation between dispatched and what was predicted to happen in the operation point in a three-dimensional analysis approach, considering renewable energy generation, battery State of Charge (SOC) and load curve. The system categorized the deviation in three possible quantities (small, medium, or high) and it acts accordingly. For the Next Operation Point predictor are used an artificial neural network (ANN) methodology. For the Decision Support System, it’s used a fuzzy logic system to adjust the next operation point, and it uses a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach when the deviation is too high, and the dispatched operation is unfeasible. Simulations with real data and information of a pilot project of MD are carried out to test and validate the proposed method. Results show that the methodology used to attend the matters of uncertainties and variation of energy generation.

The integration of distributed generation, energy storage systems, and other technologies have emerged the concept of microgrids and their smaller version, called nanogrids. Micro and nanogrids makes smart grids feasible, which allows a greater user autonomy and higher benefits to both utility grid and consumer. However, from the user's perspective, the initial investment in a nanogrid is still high, demanding an accurate financial analysis to evaluate the most adequate size of the generators and storage system. In this scenario, this work proposes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based software that analyzes the global cost of a residential nanogrid composed by battery energy storage system, solar photovoltaic and wind generation. The software evaluates the nanogrid investment costs and energy costs applying different quantities to each components. The results show that the PSO algorithm has good convergence and consistence in providing the optimal results. The optimal result for the analyzed data is an exclusive 5.1 kWp solar system, that is, without wind generation and battery storage system. This arrangement potentially provides a cost reduction of 27% in a 30-year horizon analysis. The low wind speed in the analyzed location and the still elevated acquisition prices made the inclusion of these technologies not profitable and thus not included in the software optimal results. © 2021 IEEE},

In this paper we develop and apply a multi-method qualitative and computational approach to provide a catalogue of climate crisis mitigation technologies on the EU level between 2014 and 2020. Using the approach, we observed no public EU-level funding for multiple technologies prioritised by the EU, such as low-carbon production and use of cement and chemicals, electric battery, and a number of industrial decarbonisation processes. We observed a rising trend in the funding of solar power and onshore wind, the adjacent to them power-to-X technology, as well as recycling. At the same time, the shares of funding into fuel cell, biofuel, demand-side energy management, microgrids, and waste management show a decline trend. With note of the exploratory character of the present paper, we propose that the EU Horizon 2020 funding of clean technologies only partially reflected the expectations of key institutionalised EU actors due to the existence of many non-funded prioritised technologies. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {A new design for microtracked concentrating photovoltaics (mCPVs) published by one of us in Nature Energy has the same form factor as PV. This paper analyzes the cost below which it would compete with PV in behind-the-meter applications for commercial electricity customers in four cities in southern United States, assuming that the only significant differences between mCPV and PV are mCPV's higher efficiency and mCPV's inability to utilize sunlight that is either diffuse or has a high angle of incidence. The analysis first optimizes PV and mCPV microgrids and then selects the battery capacity that maximizes the internal rate of return (IRR) and selects a target mCPV installed cost for which the optimal mCPV IRR matches the optimal PV IRR. The result for projects starting in 2020 is $1.2/W in Lancaster, CA and Las Vegas, cities with similar ratios of direct to total irradiance. Modesto, CA and Kansas City have target mCPV installed costs of $1.07/W and $0.94/W, respectively. The electricity tariff and battery costs impact both PV and mCPV and have a minimal effect on the mCPV cost at which the two technologies compete. mCPV occupies 33.2% less area per watt than PV reducing some components of installed cost. In 2020, target mCPV module costs are $0.33/W in Lancaster and Las Vegas, $0.25/W in Modesto, and $0.17/W in Kansas City. These target costs decline by on average 9.6% per year for projects starting 2021–2025, similar to the 9.3% rate of decline in projected PV module costs over this period. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The increasing use of distributed and renewable energy resources presents a challenge for traditional control methods due to the higher complexity and uncertainty brought by these new technologies. To address these challenges, rein-forcement learning algorithms are used to design and implement an energy management system (EMS) for different microgrids configurations. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach seeks to train an agent from their interaction with the environment rather than from direct data such as in supervised learning. With this in mind, the problem of energy management is be posed as a Markov decision process and it is solved using different state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms, such as Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3). Additionally, these results are compared with traditional EMS implementations such as Rule-Based and Model Predictive Control (MPC) used as benchmarks. Simulations are run with the novel Pymgrid module build for this purpose. Preliminary results show that RL agents have comparable results to the classical implementations with some possible benefits for generic and specific use cases.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Smart Micro Grid also enables the availability of energy management services supported by Machine Learning (ML) technology, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and smart sensors so that consumer use of electricity is more efficient. To improve energy management services and distribution of renewable energy sources, new innovations in ML technology are needed to produce accurate learning models that can be used in the energy analysis process, such as monitoring, prediction, forecasting, scheduling and decision-making. However, the complexity of the problems in the smart grid system, which includes uncertainty and non-linearity, affects the more complex the energy data structure generated. Therefore, the simple ML method will not be able to perform the Learning process because it is limited to simple raw data processing. Therefore, the Deep Learning (DL) method can be used as a Learning method on data that has a complex and large structure.

Since most distributed generation and energy storage devices are mostly powered by direct current, DC distribution technology has got more and more attention. Aiming at the difference of energy efficiency between AC and DC microgrid, this paper proposes the analysis method of "the efficiency of source side with distributed generation", establishes a mathematical model of system loss of AC and DC microgrid with distributed generation and sets up a selection principle of distribution system mode through the intersection point of system loss rate, from the perspective of energy efficiency. The calculation results show that the loss rate of DC microgrid with distributed power source is lower than that of AC microgrid supposing the DC load ratio is 50%. The system loss rate curve confirms the necessity of DC distribution system technology research. With the continuous access of distributed generation and energy storage devices to microgrids, and the increasing improvement of DC load rate, the DC microgrid with distributed generation will have more advantages in the future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

However, the addition of the distributed generation units and the ability of the microgrids to operate both in the grid-connected mode and the islanded mode have thrown a new set of challenges for the protection researchers because of the bidirectional power flow, uncertainty about the amount of power flow and wide variations in the fault current magnitude depending upon a variety of factors such as mode of operation, the structure of the network, and type, rating, location and number of distributed generation units.

The flexible DC transmission system not only solves the above shortcomings, but also has the advantages of independently controllable power and power supply to passive network. It is widely applied in distributed power generation by new energy, micro grid and other fields. This paper takes the two-terminal flexible DC transmission system as the research object, establishes the mathematical mode of two-terminal flexible DC transmission system, and studies the basic operation mode of the system and the voltage source converter (VSC) control strategy on this basis. Considering the problems of control delay and poor responsiveness of current closed-loop control when the traditional deadbeat control is applied to VSC converters, an improved deadbeat control strategy is proposed to solve the above-mentioned defects by predicting the current sampling at k+2 moment. Finally, the co-simulation is used to verify the correctness and reliability of the above-mentioned method.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.},

The methodology of the growth and development of electrical systems with the satisfaction of electrical needs in order to contribute to real progress requires a unitary and coordinated vision of the other non-electrical needs that scales the weights of the various sectors for the global solution without being bullied. The technological innovations of new components, of the IoT and of digitization as a whole pose the definition of a complex spatial-temporal reality consisting of structured systems and virtual-dynamic systems.

	abstract = {Microgrids are new technologies for integrating renewable energies into power systems. Optimal operation of renewable energy sources in standalone micro-grids is an intensive task due to the continuous variation of their output powers and intermittant nature. This work addresses the optimum operation of an independent microgrid considering the demand response program (DRP). An energy management model with two different scenarios has been proposed to minimize the costs of operation and emissions. Interruptible/curtailable loads are considered in DRPs. Besides, due to the growing concern of the developing efficient optimization methods and algorithms in line with the increasing needs of microgrids, the focus of this study is on using the whale meta-heuristic algorithm for operation management of microgrids. The findings indicate that the whale optimization algorithm outperforms the other known algorithms such as imperialist competitive and genetic algorithms, as well as particle swarm optimization. Furthermore, the results show that the use of DRPS has a significant impact on the costs of operation and emissions. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In many pilot research and development (RD) microgrid projects, engine-based generators are employed in their power systems, either generating electrical energy or being mixed with the heat and power technology. One of the critical tasks of such engine-based generation units is the frequency regulation in the islanded mode of modernized microgrid (MMG) operation; MMGs are microgrids equipped with advanced controls to address more emerging scenarios in smart grids. For having a stable and reliable MMG, we need to synthesize an optimal, robust, primary frequency controller for the islanded mode of MMG of the future. This task is challenging because of unknown mechanical parameters, occurrence of uncertain disturbances, uncertainty of loads, operating point variations, and the appearance of engine delays, and hence nonminimum phase dynamics. This article presents an innovative primary frequency control for the engine generators regulating the frequency of an islanded MMG in the context of smart grids. The proposed approach is based on an adaptive optimal output-feedback control algorithm using adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). The convergence of algorithms, along with the stability analysis of the closed-loop system, is also shown in this article. Finally, as experimental validation, hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test results are provided in order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed methodology practically. Note to Practitioners - This article was motivated by the problem of primary frequency controls in modernized microgrids (MMGs) using engine generators, which are still one of the prime sources of regulating frequency in pilot research and development (RD) microgrid projects. Although MMGs will be integral parts of the smart grid of the future, their primary controls in the islanded mode are not advanced enough and not considering existing theoretical challenges scientifically. Existing approaches to regulate frequency using industrially accepted methods are highly model-based and not optimal. Besides, they are not considering the nonminimum phase dynamics. These dynamics are mainly associated with the engine delays - an inherent issue of mechanical parts - for islanded microgrids. This article suggests a new adaptive optimal output-feedback control approach based on the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) to the abovementioned problem under consideration. By using the proposed methodology, MMGs can deal with the issues mentioned earlier, which are challenging. The proposed approach is optimally rejecting uncertain disturbances (considering the load uncertainty and operating point variations) and reducing the impacts of nonminimum phase dynamics caused by the engine delay. Based on our currently available hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) device's capability of modeling power systems' components in real time, our HIL-based experiments demonstrate that this approach is feasible. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the wide application of advanced information technology in smart energy system, the multi energy trading market under the energy Internet is facing many new challenges. Based on the blockchain technology, this paper constructed a co-governance transaction environment between aggregators and multi-microgrid in the microgrid cluster, and designed an alliance of aggregators and microgrids cluster transaction architecture and its block data structure under the blockchain network. Based on the principle of multi energy complementary, a node model considering carbon quota mechanism and environmental identification factor was established for the aggregator nodes, and the microgrid nodes including combined cooling heating and power (CCHP) system. Based on the new energy trading mode between aggregators and microgrid nodes, the environment identification factor incentive mechanism of dynamic cooperative game and the intelligent contract supported by MOEA/D (multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition) were designed, and the co-governance coefficient was proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of the microgrid group operation strategy. Finally, the simulation results show that, on the basis of ensuring the utility of each transaction node, the block chain co governance transaction mode can provide strong support for the coordinated optimization and complementarity of multiple energy sources, it also can promote the local consumption of renewable energy power generation, and contribute to the low-carbon sustainable development of microgrid cluster. © 2021 Chin.

Firstly, the CNN model is used to label and classify the microgrid source-load-storage integrated characteristics images to narrow down the search scope of the historical operating state image library and improve the matching efficiency; subsequently, the ORB algorithm is used to extract the features and match the image similarity to finally mine the historical similar operating state, so as to draw on the microgrid regulation strategy of the historical similar operating state to formulate the next cycle strategy of energy storage and controllable load, so as to achieve the objective of maximizing the local consumption of renewable energy in the microgrid. The simulation analysis of a microgrid system in a typical weather day scenario shows that this method can effectively classify and match the microgrid operating state of the new dispatch period to the corresponding historical similar operating state, and the regulation strategy of energy storage and adjustable load formulated It can effectively track the fluctuations in the output of renewable energy, thereby improving the on-site consumption of renewable energy in the microgrid. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) are solutions to integrate high shares of variable renewable energy which can contribute to more economical and environmental benefits, as well as improving the energy supply efficiency. One significant potential of MGs is an expanded opportunity to use the waste heating energy from the conversion of the primary fuel (such as natural gas) to generate electricity. The use of waste heat in combined heat and power (CHP)-based MG is more efficient to meet local load and decrease the emission pollution. Hence, this paper elaborates on optimal multi-objective scheduling of CHP-based MG coupled with compressed air energy storage (CAES), renewable energy, thermal energy storage (TES), and demand response programs through shiftable loads, which considers a reconfiguration capability. The embedded CAES, in addition to the charging/discharging scheme, can operate in a simple cycling mode and serve as a generation resource to supply local load in an emergency condition. The daily reconfiguration of MG will introduce a new generation of MG named reconfigurable microgrid (RMG) that offers more flexibility and enhances system reliability. The RMG is coupled with TES to facilitate the integration of the CHP unit that enables the operator to participate in the thermal market, in addition to the power market. The main intents of the proposed multi-objective problem are to minimize the operation cost along with a reduction in carbon emission. The epsilon-constraint technique is used to solve the multi-objective problem while fuzzy decision making is implemented to select an optimal solution among all the Pareto solutions. The electricity prices and wind power generation variation are captured as random variables in the model and the scenario-based stochastic approach is used to handle them. Simulation results prove that the simultaneous integration of multiple technologies in CHP-based RMG decreases the operation cost and emission up to 3 % and 10.28 %, respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The evolution of clean energy technology brings notable favor to the microgrid to tackle the ever-increasing energy demand. However, the inconsistent and dynamic behavior of renewable sources necessitates the incorporation of an energy management scheme (EMS) to coordinate the distributed components in microgrid efficiently along with ensuring high efficiency and stability over the network. Thus, the proposed energy management approach is designed to regulate the energy flow optimally and for balancing the generation-demand ratio in a distributed network. With this scenario, a new muddy soil fish optimization algorithm (MSFOA) is developed with the foraging pattern of fishes aiming at minimizing the production overheads and curtail the expenses of energy import from the grid together with considering system constraints. The proposed EMS is implemented in a microgrid framework that includes solar PV, wind, diesel generator, and energy storage units. Moreover, several aspects of case studies under isolated and grid-tied scenarios substantiate the potentiality of the presented MSFOA approach. The simulation output illustrates the outstanding performance of the proposed MSFOA technique over convergence speed and solution precision with reasonably low execution time resulted in obtaining more profit than the existing method. Besides, the numerical output exhibits that the proposed MSFOA technique minimizes the overall production cost compared to the heuristic-based model predictive technique, predictor-corrector proximal multiplier, and improved differential search algorithm by 3.76%, 8.32%, and 19.3%, respectively. Finally, the proposed optimization technique has been deployed in a small testbed system to demonstrate the feasibility over real-time conditions. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy management is one of the most viable solutions to incentivize prosumers in renewable energy microgrids. As the application of blockchain expends from the finance field to energy field, blockchain technology provides a new opportunity for distributed energy systems. However, a distributed energy system based on blockchains allows any node in the whole network to read data. In many application scenarios, user privacy cannot be effectively protected, and there is a security problem that the attack cannot be traced. In this paper, we propose an energy management mode based on a permissioned blockchain for a renewable energy microgrid. The novel permissioned blockchain framework uses entity mapping with a unique identity for each enterprise, natural person, or device, in order to avoid ineligible participants to join the microgrid. Each peer entity keeps the transaction information index of the whole network, but only keeps its own specific transaction information, so they can retrieve the transaction information of other peer entities but cannot obtain the details without permission. Moreover, this model could avoid communication delays and promote plug-and-play due to the distributed nature of the permissioned blockchain. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with a demonstration program which is designed and deployed on a Hyperledger Fabric permissioned blockchain. Simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed method, and the model is conducive to the protection privacy and P2P energy management for decentralized energy systems. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {With the emerging technologies for Energy Intent (EI) and data-driven applications, the conventional power grid network is undergoing a radical modernization. An efficient energy management and electricity price forecasting remains a challenging task. In this paper, a new Robust Data Predictive Control framework for Energy Management System (RDPC-EMS) is developed to overcome the uncertainty of the electricity retail price market and minimize the total operating costs for the multi-microgrids (MMG) system. The proposed framework solves the economic energy dispatch based on an accurate Electricity Price Forecasting (EPF) by an Outlier-Robust Extreme Learning Machine (OR-ELM) algorithm and a two layers cooperative Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC). The First level provides an optimal energy scheduling between the Distribution System Operator (DSO) and cooperative microgrids systems to minimize the operating cost based on the forecasted electricity price. In contrast, second level maintains the supply-demand balance by applying the optimal energy scheduling from the first layer through an adjustment of the distributed energy resources (DER). The electricity retail price prediction is assessed using real dataset from the Iso New England electricity market. The OR-ELM regression method shows a significant forecasting performance in terms of error metrics. For instance, the mean absolute error in the training stage 2.05% for OR-ELM with a comparison of 4.17% and 6.29% for Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models respectively. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the efficiency RDPC-EMS for daily operating cost reduction, with decrease of 15% for MG 1 and 16% for MG 2. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

	abstract = {The need of clean energy is constantly increasing, and Building Integrated PhotoVoltaic (BIPV) technologies represent valuable assets to expand even further the photovoltaic market. Thanks to BIPVs. a new concept of local electric microgrid will probably emerge as this kind of technology can turn buildings from energy wells to energy sources. Luminescent Solar Concentrator (LSC) panels are perfect to achieve this goal, indeed, contrary to standard flat PhotoVoltaic (PV) modules, they can be exploited in transparent or semi-transparent building façades. Thus, the purpose of this work was the optimization of the performance of LSC panels for BIPV applications. Being an application-oriented study, we paid particular attention to the scalability of the assembling process and the use of LSC slabs functionalized only with widely available organic commercial dyes and high-performance commercial silicon solar cells. The electrical and optical performance of the LSC panels were firstly simulated and then, once the most promising configurations were identified, the respective prototypes were assembled to compare the simulation results with the experimental measurements. These analyses were performed both under uniform illumination and in some relevant shading configurations typical for BIPV devices in operating conditions. The obtained results show that LSC panels that employ PV cells coupled with reflective films can yield a higher efficiency than a traditional system with cells placed along four sides. © 2021 MDPI AG.

	abstract = {This paper concerns modeling, simulations and control design of turbo-electric distributed propulsion (TeDP) systems needed to power future hybrid aircraft systems. The approach taken is the one of control co-design by which the sizing and hardware selection of components and the TeDP architecture design are pursued so that potential effects of control and automation are accounted for from the very beginning. Unique to this approach is a multi-layered modular modeling and control approach in which technology-specific modules comprising the complex dynamical system are characterized using unified interaction variables at their interfaces with the rest of the system. The dynamical performance of the interconnected system is assessed using these technology-agnostic interface variable specifications and, as such, can be applied to any candidate architecture of interest. Importantly, even the inputs to the TeDP system coming from pilot commands are modeled using such interface variables. This new multi-layered modeling captures the dynamics of energy and power as interactions. It also has a rather straightforward physical interpretation. The paper builds on our earlier results introduced for terrestrial power systems, including small micro-grids. We show how system feasibility and stability can be checked in real-time operations by modules exchanging the information about their interaction variables and adjusting in a near-autonomous manner so that, as system conditions vary, the interconnected system still functions. No such systematic control co-design exists to the best of our knowledge, but it is needed as both new technologies and more complex, often conflicting performance objectives emerge. We illustrate the approach on a representative TeDP architecture and compare it to today's state-of-the-art. We close with a discussion on the generalization of the method for any given candidate architecture. Having such an approach dramatically reduces the R&D&D of novel candidate architectures. © 2021},

	abstract = {With the ever-increasing energy demand for energy all across the world and also, the increasing concern on environmental issues due to using fossil fuels mostly in power systems, some appropriate alternatives should be used to solve the issue. In this respect, renewable energy sources (RESs) with almost zero pollution have been turned into the first choice for supplying the required energy. In this study, to achieve the minimum total cost of the grid, a novel problem formulation is proposed to reduce the reliability costs. Simultaneously, the transportation sector has been replacing the current conventional fossil-fuel vehicles with electrified ones, where plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) as well as plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) have captured the attention and there is an increasing rate in using electric vehicles (EVs). These vehicles are capable of connecting to the electrical grid to absorb/deliver energy from/to the grid through the grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies. On the other hand, a new concept in power systems, namely microgrid (MG) has been introduced to facilitate the integration of RESs and make the most of EVs’ capabilities using the smart infrastructure. In fact, the vehicle to grid (V2G) capability is used to decrease the operating cost to achieve a proper opportunity to accommodate PEVs in the network. The output power produced by RESs is volatile, which is more obvious in wind energy and solar power. Thus, the resource management issue of MGs would be of very high significance. In this regard, this paper proposes an efficient optimization framework for the optimal day-ahead energy management of MGs, including PEVs and RESs, utilizing an effective stochastic programming method, i.e. unscented transformation (UT). It is significant to note that the problem has tackled as a single-objective stochastic optimization problem, while the objective has been defined as minimizing the total cost of operation, The presented stochastic optimization problem is then solved by employing a nature-inspired efficient method, named “modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MSFLA)” and the obtained results are compared to those reported by other methods to verify its performance. © 2020},

	abstract = {With high proportion of renewable energy and the improvement of sensing and communication equipment in the smart grid, the autonomy of the multi agents to participate in market transactions has increased. But it is difficult to smooth power's fluctuation and achieve a fair distribution of costs and benefits. Based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and energy blockchain technology, this paper proposes a real-time multiagent power transaction framework and optimization model. The method firstly predicts the real-time demand response (DR) in electrical power with the price changes using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Then, an optimizition model is built to pursue multiple subjects' respective benefit and optimize the microgrids' internal economy. Further, the distribution network operator monitors the system security, returns the corrected results to the microgrid for circular optimization. Finally, the improved particle swarm algorithm is used to solve the established model. A case study proves that the model can effectively smooth the power fluctuation of new energy, stimulate users to participate in the market DR, and realize the safety, economy, and fairness of smart grid operation in the new environment.  © 2021 KIEE & EMECS.},

Given that this traditional planning approach is not very flexible, and due to new technological trends like the adoption of smart grids, it has become necessary for demand to play an active role in the operation of power systems. This raises the need to implement a new process for power system planning, focusing on technologies such as microgrids with Demand Side Management, which contribute to the sustainable development of communities. In this paper, a comprehensive review of microgrid planning, considering energy end-user participation through Demand Response, is carried out. In addition, the main features and implications of Demand Response programs in microgrid planning are presented. As a contribution, in order to trigger a paradigm shift on how power systems are planned, the benefits of bottom-up microgrid planning are presented. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {The rapid increase of distributed generations (DGs), including both nonrenewable and renewable energy resources, led the energy sector to transform in a way that seemed improbable in the last few years. In the following of this transformation, multiple energy carriers have been integrated into the new infrastructure, namely multicarrier microgrid (MCMG), to operate together. In addition, multienergy storage systems (MESSs) have emerged, which have a significant role in the multienergy markets. MESSs can participate in the energy markets by saving energy at off-peak hours and delivering at on-peak hours. To this end, a scheduling model MCMG is proposed in this chapter, in which the proposed model can handle different uncertainties using stochastic programming. One of the considered energy storage systems is the hydrogen storage system (HSS), which is a novel technology to save power as hydrogen gas, i.e., power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology, at low electricity prices and convert hydrogen-to-power (H2P) using hydrogen fuel cell at high electricity price hours if required. Moreover, demand response (DR) program is applied to the system with the aim of controlling end users’ load patterns and involving them in the scheduling program. The proposed model is formulated as mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), then the effectiveness of the model is verified through simulation and numerical results. Obtained results show that utilization of the MESSs decreases total operation cost up to 3%. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

A new approach for the design of microgrid with a reverse osmosis desalination plant system called coordinated sizing is proposed in this manuscript. The proposed algorithm is a leader-follower structured optimization process. The desalination plant is segregated as units and each unit can be operated independently as required. A direct load control-demand side management is incorporated into the sizing process to determine the optimal flexible operation of the desalination plant and microgrid's power dispatch simultaneously. A conceptual microgrid powering desalination plant is considered to evaluate performance of the proposed coordinated sizing method. Different evolutionary algorithms are applied for solving the sizing problem and the results are analyzed. The proposed coordinated sizing method is compared with the conventional sizing method. With and without the flexible operation of desalination plant cases are considered to compare economy of the plant. The results demonstrate that the proposed coordinated sizing is cost-effective and provide better operational flexibility. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {With emerging the new technologies for making photovoltaic cells, increasing energy demand, preventing air pollution and encouraging investors to implement solar farms, the use of photovoltaic systems to create green and modern cities is receiving great attention. Due to the output voltage level of solar units and farms, this technology should have a suitable growth for connection to distribution grids and microgrids. However, the problems of overvoltage due to the high penetration of solar sources in low load conditions or high-power generation conditions of solar units is a major challenge that must be properly investigated. Reduction of active power injected into the grid by solar units and exchange of reactive power with the grid to overcome this challenge is suggested by researchers. However, these solutions have challenges such as the loss of significant profits for the owners of solar farms due to preventing the injection of maximum power into the grid or reducing the life of inverters due to the injection of reactive power. To solve this issue, in this paper, the optimal method of active and reactive power exchange between the solar unit and the grid for different solar units is proposed and its implementation with the help of smart inverters is discussed. In the proposed method, the power factor for the solar units of each region and the power cut rate is determined to minimize the total cut-off active power and the reactive power exchanged with the grid while the voltage level is maintained below the critical value. The PSO algorithm is used to optimize the objective functions. MATLAB/Simulink is used to show the feasibility of the proposed method to solve the overvoltage issue in the smart grids. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Increased investments into renewable energy as distributed energy sources throughout the distribution grid are a driving force behind the need to adopt smart grid advances. Issues such as intermittency of generation from these renewables have been studied concerning the stability of the grid at higher penetration levels. One need that industry meetings have pointed out is the need for forecasting models and advanced controls that mitigate the intermittency effects. Wide-scale adoption of computing nodes into the power grid such as smart meters and smart inverters have transformed the traditional grid into a cyber-physical system (CPS), as well as independent CPS nodes such as microgrids. Centralized command and control are necessary to maintain visibility over resources and management of them. With developments in cyber-physical-systems integrations more distributed controllers are potential. Data collection becomes a more challenging task as the number of intelligent devices in the field that generates data increases. New key-store based database technologies could be utilized in highly heterogeneous data environments. One of the potential distributed CPS controllers are demonstrated in this paper is a case study of a forecasting based economic dispatch controller for large scale PV power plant that is part of the energy mix. The cost in this scenario is found to be lower when the controller is used. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The pressure of climate change and the need for the adoption of renewable sources have led to a strong development of technology within microgrids (μG). The modular and scalable nature presents opportunities for the development of a new class of users in μG (i.e. the prosumers). The large-scale integration of small-scale renewable energy sources (SSRES) creates challenges for today's classic electricity distribution networks. The paper proposes a simulation method for optimal integration of prosumers to minimize active power losses in μG. For a deeper analysis regarding the influence of the prosumers on the μG power losses, 24 hour real load consumption and generation profiles are used. The study's findings show that a more effective μG operation by the optimal allocation of the PV panels on the μG can decrease the active power losses up to 35% in a day. © 2021 IEEE.},

The power electronic interface cannot provide inertia and damping support for the microgrid. The virtual synchronous generator technology is introduced into the inverter control system. Unlike the synchronous generator, its parameters are flexible and adjustable, which can enhance the robustness of the microgrid. This paper firstly analyzes the influence of the moment of inertia and damping on the system, it is based on the equivalent relationship between the three-phase inverter and the synchronous machine, combined with the VSG rotor motion equation, and conducts stability analysis based on the small signal model and root locus. Based on the existing control strategy, a virtual synchronous generator cooperative control strategy based on the optimal damping ratio is proposed. Finally, the VSG collaborative control model is built in MATLAB/Simlink, the experimental results show that the proposed control strategy effectively improves the transient performance of the VSG, the system active power overshoot is reduced from 5% to 0, and the frequency deviation peak is lowered from 0.174 Hz to 0.115 Hz, which confirms the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Due to the low overcurrent capacity of VSGs, fault ride-through (FRT) is necessary for microgrids, which makes the transient stability of SG-VSG-based microgrids be different from the traditional power system. In this paper, a new abnormal overcurrent phenomenon caused by FRT is discovered in SG-VSG-based islanded microgrids. Then, characteristics of the output current of the VSG which uses different parameters are compared and analyzed. Furthermore, an optimized FRT method is proposed, which suppresses the abnormal overcurrent.

	abstract = {In microgrids a distributed storage is efficient, but in the concept of microgrids the management of generation, storage and the flow between microgrids is needed. The economical situation has to be taken into account also. Nanogrids are smaller size of microgrids, but have the same main features. In an office environment one office could be one nanogrid. We simulated the behaviour of the different components of the office nanogrid to obtain information about the possible time necessary for charging and discharging a battery with given capacity. One possible extension to the nanogrid concept is the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) devices battery to extend the storage capacity. To optimize the charging of ICT devices the battery management system (BMS) has to be extended with a software solution to obtain information from the state of the batteries. Simulations are run to characterize the battery behaviour of ICT devices and its effect on the office nanogrid. With the users calendar entries the software has to predict when the fully charged state of the battery is expected, which also needs the charging times of the different devices batteries. Further investigation is needed to show if this prediction is also possible without the software part providing the battery state of charge. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

This paper focuses on the stability of DC microgrid. In this paper, the structure of DC microgrid is introduced in detail. Based on the model of each unit of DC microgrid, the operation principle and control strategy are analyzed. Then, the simplified model of DC microgrid is established, and the impedance ratio type criteria is used to determine the stability of DC microgrid and analyze the influence of some factors, such as the constant power load(CPL), the line inductance and the capacitor of converter, on the stability of the system. A DC microgrid simulation model is established based on Matlab / Simulink. On the basis of ensuring its stable operation, it is proved that reducing the line inductance and increasing the capacitor can improve the stability of the system; The constant power load with negative impedance characteristics has a greater effect on the stability of the system is verified by comparing the stability of the system in the same increments of CPL and resistive load. Moreover, it shows that the poorly damped LC filter in DC microgrid will have interaction with the constant power load and bring in unstable high-frequency oscillations. To solve the problem, a compensation method based on high-pass filter is proposed. The simulation results show that this method can effectively suppress the oscillation and improve the stability of the system. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The evolution of small-scaled distributed generators and emerging power electronic devices opens up a new arena of power generation, distribution, and consumption. Operationally, the DC microgrid has attracted significant attention as it offers considerable safety benefits, cost-effectiveness, energy efficiency, and reliability as compared to traditional AC microgrid systems. Looking at the protection aspects, the DC microgrid has some serious issues both for low-voltage and mid-voltage DC system. It needs to be focused on bidirectional power flow, non-zero crossing point, detection and mitigation of grounding faults, high value of fault current, etc., for an adequate solution. In recent times, these issues are considered by various researchers to arrive at a robust and reliable approach toward protecting the DC microgrid. But certain important areas are still out of sight for researchers. In a blend of conventional and modern approaches, there are many hindrances in developing a flexible universal protective scheme. This work focuses on the protection aspects parallel with the challenges and tried to unearth the loopholes which open up a wider area of research to develop a more robust protective architecture. An extensive review has been done systematically and chronologically keeping in mind the DC microgrid architecture, standards, protection hurdles, traditional as well as latest protective measures, and suggested some reliable improvements. In addition, the futuristic possibility to invent a novel comprehensive approach based on the best technology and techniques is presented in a more secure, reliable, and efficient protection system to combat the power system faults, keeping in view the different modes of operation and configuration of the microgrid. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

The proposed MEM is equipped with wind energy, multi-carrier energy storage technologies, boiler, combined heat and power unit, P2G, EVs, and demand response with the aim of total operational cost minimization. Meanwhile, the system operator can participate in three electricity, heat, and gas market to meet local demands as well as achieve desired profits through energy exchanges. The proposed MEM is exposed to high-level uncertainties due to wind energy, demand, the initial and final state of charge of EVs, arrival and departure times of EVs, as well as power price. A hybrid robust/stochastic framework is used to capture all random variables and distinguishes between the level of conservatism in the decision-making procedure. The electricity price uncertainty is addressed by a robust approach, while a stochastic framework models other uncertainties of the system. Simulations are provided for different cases, which results revealed that the integrated scheduling of MEM in the presence of emerging technologies, incorporated with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability, reduces the total operational cost by 14.2 %. © 2020},

	abstract = {With the deepening of the 'source-load-storage' interaction and the development of demand response technology, the emergence of prosumers has led to new vitality and potential for the optimal operation of microgrids. By implementing a demand response mechanism for prosumers, peak shaving and valley filling are realized, and load fluctuations are balanced. However, the high costs of investing and operating energy storage system (ESS) restrict their ability to participate in the scheduling of microgrids. In this paper, for the objectives of obtaining the lowest comprehensive costs and the smallest load fluctuations, an INSGA-II (Improved Fast Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm) algorithm is proposed for the multiobjective configuration optimization model of a prosumer's ESS. To ensure the diversity of the population and improve the search ability of the algorithm in space, based on the original NSGA-II algorithm, the proportion factor set in the selection strategy is improved. The normal distribution crossover operator is introduced in the crossover process, and the local chaotic search strategy is added after the formation of the next generation of the population. An example of a science and technology park with five users is simulated and analyzed. Upon comparison with various typical intelligent algorithms, the results show that the performance of the improved NSGA-II algorithm is the best. At the same time, multiple calculation results show that the improved NSGA-II algorithm has strong algorithmic stability. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microgrid planning philosophies are changing from islanding in the case of abnormal conditions to independent sustainability for constant secure, reliable operation. Large independent operators foresee a shift from gigantic-grid bulk generation and transmission to distributed generation (DG) from smaller, interlinked grid clusters. Customers and the community will benefit, but system operators and utilities will face challenges. Introduced to enhance electricity exchange and the energy market structure in such grids, transactive energy networks favor customers and DG owners, establish a utility business model, and enable power system innovation. Planners are also increasingly interested in blockchains for secure transactions. Blockchain-based transactive energy markets promise flexibility, transparency, security, competition, and superlative low-cost reliability, offering ideal energy-trading solutions in isolated microgrids and distribution-level markets. This article presents the development and case-study validation of a comprehensive transactive energy market framework with linked blockchain and power system layers, a novel market structure based on an end-user marginal price, and an adapted blockchain that fits intrinsic power system requirements. A new slot-ahead electricity market model is established through integration with the modified blockchain. With blockchain operation, monetary funds are managed equitably so that wallet billing rates for customers, utilities, and DG owners match broadcast smart-meter data. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

Therefore, secondary frequency and voltage regulation control is proposed to re-establish the active power frequency balance point and reactive power voltage balance point of microgrid system under island operation mode.

First, the honey encryption (HE) technology and advanced encryption standard (AES) are combined to propose a new encryption algorithm HE-AES, which is used to encrypt the preprocessed data. Second, the Kademlia algorithm is embedded in the edge server to realize the distributed storage and automatic recovery of microgrid data. Finally, the traditional proof of authority (PoA) consensus mechanism is improved partially, and the improved PoA is used to make each node reach consensus and pack blocks on the chain. The scheme can not only realize the data disaster backup automatically but also has high efficiency of data processing, which can provide a new idea for improving the current data disaster backup schemes. © 2021 Lihua Zhang et al.},

	abstract = {Distribution feeder microgrid (DFM) built based on existing distributed feeder (DF), is a promising solution for modern microgrid. DFM contains a large number of heterogeneous devices that generate heavy network traffice and require a low data delivery latency. The information-centric networking (ICN) paradigm has shown a great potential to address the communication requirements of smart grid. However, the integration of advanced information and communication technologies with DFM make it vulnerable to cyber attacks. Adequate authentication of grid devices is essential for preventing unauthorized accesses to the grid network and defending against cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose a new lightweight anonymous device authentication scheme for DFM supported by named data networking (NDN), a representative implementation of ICN.We perform a security analysis to show that the proposed scheme can provide security features such as mutual authentication, session key agreement, defending against various cyber attacks, anonymity, and resilience against device capture attack. The security of the proposed scheme is also formally verified using the popular AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool. The computational and communication costs of the proposed scheme are evaluated. Our results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significantly lower computational, communication and energy costs than other state-of-The-Art schemes. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Variability in electric power systems is increasing, resulting in a need for new approaches in control. The greater variability originates from distributed energy resources and increasing demand for personalized energy choice from customers at the grid edge. This issue is further accentuated in rural communities that are seeing an increasing interest in deploying resilient microgrids. Electricity distribution systems incorporate increasing numbers of intelligent end devices, automated switchgear, and sensing and measurement devices, which are providing more visibility and potential control at the grid edge. Traditional distribution system planning and operations techniques must evolve to manage the new complexity while continuing to deliver safe, reliable, and cost-effective energy. New technologies are enabling new capabilities at the grid edge to respond to these needs. Distributed applications can deploy intelligence across the distribution grid with peer-to-peer communications and a shared data context for their local environment. These applications can cooperate to quickly respond to changing grid conditions. This enables a layered coordination framework that spans the centralized advanced distribution management system functions with wide-area visibility of the new distributed applications that are running at intelligent devices and meters throughout the distribution system. This paper describes an open-architecture, open-source system approach for large scale integration of devices and intelligence at the grid edge.  © 2021 IEEE.},

This article presents smart energy dispatch for multi-MGs (MMGs) systems based on the cooperative distributed economic model predictive control (DEMPC) within a hierarchical structure. The optimization framework consists of two levels. First, a DEMPC coordinator computes the optimal energy dispatch solution, taking into account the energy surplus with a power-sharing policy, the retail electricity price based on the time of use (TOU), and the distributed generators units. For the second level, each local controller executes the energy scheduling reference from the first level. Thus, the MMGs system achieves a global supply-demand balance. Moreover, the proposed approach improves the utilization of renewable power and demonstrates optimal energy dispatch while reducing operating costs. Finally, to validate the efficiency and resiliency of our proposed approach, two cases of study are presented based on three interconnected MGs system under a cooperative and non-cooperative optimization. Simulation results show the advantage of the cooperative strategy with 28% for MG 1, and 20% for MG 2 in terms of daily operating costs savings. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {The high-penetration of distributed generation technologies in the form of MicroGrids (MGs), in recent years, has increased the risk of frequency instability since their energy is supplied by renewable energy resources (RESs) with uncertain nature. Under such circumstances, providing an MG model with an efficient load frequency control (LFC) has a fundamental role in restoring the stability of the unstructured power system. In this study, a hybrid power system with the application of the Tidal Power Unit (TPU) and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) is effectively planed as an isolated MG. A new fractional gradient descent (FGD) based on a single-input interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (SIT2-FLC) is suggested as the main LFC controller, where the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) coefficient of the SIT2-FLC is specifically adjusted to enhance the LFC performance. Additionally, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) with the actor-critic framework is considered to generate the supplementary control action, which is useful for the frequency stabilization by adapting to the randomness of load disturbances and RESs. Lastly, a model-in-the-loop (MiL) simulation is conducted to appraise the feasibility and applicability of the suggested design method from a systemic perspective. © 2017 IEEE.},

The analyzed systems are connected to the power grid and operate independently: a fixed system with optimal all-year-round angular positioning and an astronomical-sensor-controlled dual-axis tracking system. The systems under consideration consist of PV modules with a unit electrical power of 200 Wp, and the production technology of those modules is the same. The tested systems were located on the building rooftop of the Faculty of Control, Robotics and Electrical Engineering of the Poznan University of Technology in Poland (Central Poland, 52◦ 24.4152′ N, 16◦ 55.7958′ E) at a height of 30 m above ground level. The measurements take into account the consumption of electricity by the actuators of the dual-axis positioning system. Increases in the produced electricity by 35.6% and 44.7% were observed for local climatic conditions during the first and second measuring years, respectively, when comparing the use of the dual-axis tracking system with the use of fixed units. Results show that the analyzed region of central Poland, represented by the city of Poznań, creates favorable climatic conditions for the use of astronomical-sensor spatial positioning systems for photovoltaic modules, also in the case of a significant share of diffuse solar radiation in the global value. These results may make the planning of solar tracking investments easier and help with the estimate calculations of the total investment return period and operational costs. © 2021 by the authors.

In this paper, this combination of technologies and regulations is examined in the Portuguese context. The new regulations dealing with self-consumption from prosumers are combined with smart contracts and distributed ledger technology to formulate an automated energy trading system for residential end-users in local energy markets. Results show that including prosumers in the local energy market brings significant benefits to all market participants. Additionally, results show that the newly created regulatory role of a Market Facilitator is beneficial to these type of local energy exchanges. © 2021 IEEE.},

For that, the small-disturbance linearized state equation of two-terminal DC microgrid with constant power load is firstly derived to solve the problem of DC voltage oscillation instability. Secondly, the oscillation current and voltage are selected as adjustable control parameters by the coordination of participation factors for each state variable, which are introduced into the duty cycle feedback link of energy storage converter and constant power load converter respectively, so that the multi-terminal DC voltage oscilla-tion control method based on state feedback is proposed. Thirdly, the root locus and Bode diagram are used to analyze the variation law of stability margin for DC microgrid with additional state feedback voltage oscillation control technology, which provides the basis for control parameter design. Finally, a time-domain simulation system is built to verify that the proposed control method can effectively suppress the voltage oscillation of DC microgrid and significantly improve the system dynamic stability. © 2021, Electric Power Automation Equipment Press.

Nowadays, there is large penetration of PV units into the grid and the stability of the overall system may get affected when a new Distributed Energy Resource (DER) is added to the system. In this paper, stability analysis of a DC microgrid with single as well as multiple PV units and battery is carried out using the transfer function model. A DC microgrid having a single bus topology and multiple DERs, controlled using multi-loop control is considered for the analysis. The effect of penetration of DERs on the stability of the system is investigated using the eigenvalue approach. A system with communication delay is also considered for the analysis. From the analysis it can be seen that, addition of a new DER unit into the system affects the stability and hence the controller gains needs to be re-Tuned to bring the system back to the stable state.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The electric power systems together with the entire energy sector are rapidly evolving towards a low-carbon, secure, and competitive economy facing revolutionary transformations from technical structure to economic value chain. Pathways to achieve sustainability led to the development of new technologies, accommodation of larger shares of unpredictable and stochastic electricity transfer from sources to end-users without loss of reliability, new business models and services, data management, and so on. The new technologies and incentives for local energy communities along with large development of microgrids are main forces driving the evolution of the low voltage energy sector changing the context and paradigm of rigid contractual binding between utilities and end-user customers (now progressing to flexible prosumers with generation and storage capabilities). The flexibility and operation of a prosumer can be enhanced by a non-intrusive time-frequency analysis of distorted power quality waveforms for both generation and demand at the point of common connection. Therefore, it becomes of importance to discriminate among successive quasi-steady-state operation of a given local system using only the aggregated waveforms information available in the PCC. This paper focuses on the Hilbert–Huang method with modifications such as empirical mode decomposition improved with masking signals based on the Fast Fourier Transform, Hilbert spectral analysis, and a post-processing method for separating components and their amplitudes and frequencies within distorted power signals for a low-voltage prosumer operation. The method is used for a time-frequency-magnitude representation with promising localization capabilities enabling efficient operation for prosumers. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The integration of distributed generation based on renewable energy resources in microgrid systems are increasing in recent years. However, the intermittent characteristics of renewable energy result in some stability issues. One solution towards microgrid stability improvement is to provide virtual inertia by using virtual synchronous generator (VSG), which is adapting the conventional synchronous generator dynamic characteristics. Despite of the increasing VSG's development, there is no review study that observes various models and control algorithms of the technology. To fill this gap, this paper presents a review of different modeling and control algorithms that were presented along with a detailed description of parameters. This paper can be used as a guide for starting a new research on VSG model and control algorithm in microgrid applications. Finally, the main technical challenges, relevant key issues, suggested research needs, and a new perspective are discussed. © 2021 IEEE.},

As the number of power electronic converters in modern grids continues to grow, their monitoring and coordinated grid-supportive services have become subjects of increased practical interest. Recent standards have also specified mandatory set of control parameters for grid-tied converters, which should be monitored by a remote entity that sends commands through a communication network. Although remote control capability enables numerous new control functions for grid-tied converters, it also makes them vulnerable to cyber attacks. Hence, this chapter aims to shed light on portions of the power electronic converter control systems, which are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Next, some of the prominent cyber attacks are overviewed by considering numerous grid-tied converter applications. Further, some of the common cyber attack detection and mitigation principles have been discussed in brief.

High penetration of RES also come along with greater demand for more effective control approaches, congestion management techniques, and microgrids optimal dispatch. Most of the secondary control methods of microgrid systems in the autonomous mode require communication links between the distributed generators (DGs) for sharing power information and data for control purposes. This article gives ample review on the communication induced impairments in islanded microgrids. In the review, attention is given to communication induced delay, data packet loss, and cyber-attack that degrades optimal operations of islanded microgrids. The review also considered impairments modelling, the impact of impairments on microgrids operation and management, and the control methods employed in mitigating some of their negative impacts. The paper revealed that innovative control solutions for impairment mitigation rather than the development of new high-speed communication infrastructure should be implemented for microgrid control. It was also pointed out that a sparse communication graph is the basis for communication topology design for distributed secondary control in the microgrid. © 2021 International Journal of Pharmaceutical Research and Allied Sciences.

	abstract = {The ever-growing development in communication technology and very fast advances in data science are transferring the power systems in a new era. The level of autonomy is improving by means of Internet-of-Things (IoT), while the level of intelligence is improving through artificial intelligence. The applications of big data analytics and cloud computing techniques in smart grids are also new topics, which have been paid particular attention recently. These paradigms can be used in both grid-scale and local-scale, while the central grid operation center has interoperability with an abundant number of sub-controllers, and aggregators in a wide variety of scales. On the one hand, the system operator must deal with multiple parameters with different kinds of uncertainties. On the other hand, the new structures are evolving toward transactive energy trading models in microgrids. In such a circumstance, a myriad of elements is producing critical data, which should be acquired, transferred, stored, analyzed, and finally, proper controlling actions must be sent. These data are producing at different intervals, even in a fraction of a second. This matter makes it possible to maintain grid security and better real-time operation as well as to get better demand responsiveness. A smart grid consists of many embedded or interconnected systems that are linked to each other through various communication platforms in the cyber layer. A flexible, highly-autonomous, and intelligent smart grid entails an agile communication system, whether wired or wireless. However, cellular networks have prominent benefits. Hence, 5G technology, which is state-of-the-art technology in this field, can be deployed. The communication infrastructure links many components to each other in cyber-physical smart grids. The velocity of data exchange has a profound importance for some purposes, while 5G technology can be the best solution. The joint integration of IoT and 5G procures more reliability, resiliency, security, and economy. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article provides a detailed analysis of the power electronics solutions enabling bipolar dc grids. The bipolar dc grid concept has proven to be more efficient, flexible, and higher in quality than the conventional unipolar one. However, despite its many features, these systems still have to overcome their issues with asymmetrical loading to avoid voltage imbalances, besides meeting regulatory and safety requirements that are still under development. Advances in power electronics and the large-scale deployment of dc consumer appliances have put this growing architecture in the spotlight, as it has drawn the attention of different research groups recently. The following provides an insightful discussion regarding the topologies that enable these architectures and their regulatory requirements, besides their features and level of development. In addition, some future trends and challenges in the further development of this technology are discussed to motivate future contributions that address open problems and explore new possibilities.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {While industrial demand response programmes have long been valued to support the power grid, recent advances in information and communications technology have enabled new opportunities to leverage the potential of responsive loads in less energy-dense end-use sectors. This brings to light the importance of accurately projecting flexible demand-side resources in the long-term investment planning process of micro-grids. This paper introduces a customer comfort-aware, demand response-integrated long-term micro-grid planning optimisation model. The model (1) draws on non-cooperative game theory and the Stackelberg leadership principles to understand and reflect the strategic behaviour of energy utilities, demand response aggregators, and end-consumers, (2) produces optimal trade-offs between power imported from the main grid and available demand response resources, (3) determines the cost-optimal resource allocation for energy infrastructure, including multiple energy storage systems, and (4) provides a level playing field for emerging technologies, such as power-to-gas and vehicle-to-grid interventions. The multi-energy-storage-technology test-case was effectively applied to achieve 100%-renewable energy generation for the town of Ohakune, New Zealand. Numerical simulation results suggest that the proposed incentive-compatible demand-side management market-clearing mechanism is able to estimate the cost-optimal solution for the provision of renewable energy during the planning phase. The cost-optimal system saves ~21% (equating to around US$5.5 m) compared to a business-as-usual approach, where the participation of end-users in demand response programmes is projected by running uniform price demand response auctions. The most salient distinction of the proposed two-stage (wholesale and retail) demand-side management market model is the continual process of trading, with incentive prices unique to each transaction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Smart microgrids (SMGs), as cyber–physical systems, are essential parts of smart grids. The SMGs’ cyber networks facilitate efficient system operation. However, cyber failures and interferences might adversely affect the SMGs. The available studies about SMGs have paid less attention to SMGs’ cyber–physical features compared to other subjects. Although a few current research works have studied the cyber impacts on SMGs’ reliability, there is a research gap about reliability evaluation simultaneously concerning all cyber failures and interferences under various cyber network topologies and renewable distributions scenarios. This article aims to fill such a gap by developing a new Monte Carlo simulation-based reliability assessment method considering cyber elements’ failures, data/information transmission errors, and routing errors under various cyber network topologies. Considering the microgrid control center (MGCC) faults in comparion to other failures and interferences is one of the major contributions of this study. The reliability evaluation of SMGs under various cyber network topologies, particularly based on an MGCC’s redundancy, highlights this research’s advantages. Moreover, studying the interactions of uncertainties for cyber systems and distributed generations (DGs) under various DG scenarios is another contribution. The proposed method is applied to a test system using actual historical data. The comparative test results illustrate the advantages of the proposed method. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The energy industry is at a crossroads. Digital technological developments have the potential to change our energy supply, trade, and consumption dramatically. The new digitalization model is powered by the artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The integration of energy supply, demand, and renewable sources into the power grid will be controlled autonomously by smart software that optimizes decision-making and operations. AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study's findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cut-throat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security.

	abstract = {Modern power systems must provide efficient, reliable, and environmentally responsible energy. Recently, the inclusion of Microgrids (MGs) has allowed us to overcome some difficulties and face important challenges in this direction, especially related to the use of alternative energy sources. Increased and probabilistic demand, as well as limited energy supply, pose the need to evaluate the reliability of any distribution system (DS) when MGs are introduced. Here we reviewed and classified the state-of-the-art of reliability assessment (RA) in MGs. Initially, we contextualize RA in distribution systems. Next, each of the MGs subsystems components are introduced and the questions (1) why is it important to evaluate the reliability in Microgrids? (2) how do Microgrids influence the reliability of distribution systems? and (3) how does each of its subsystems influence the reliability of the Microgrids? are addressed. A total of 1395 research studies were published between 2002 and 2020. Using the PRISMA model, 147 met the inclusion criteria (71% correspond to research papers and 29% to reviews; 62% were published in journals, 34% were conference papers and 4% were books). The first study dates from 1971. Despite immense advances in MGs, we identified that (1) real test systems constitute an emerging trend; (2) although new MG configurations sound promising, the development and application of new RA techniques are a necessary step towards the identification of potential pitfalls of such architectures; (3) new RA methods or variations of the existing ones, whether analytical or simulation-based, are constantly being proposed, but their comparison for a particular DS, including MGs, are yet to be performed; and (4) more research studies are needed to assess how new control strategies and information and communications technology impact MGs reliability. Future lines of research could build upon these gaps to enhance reliability, especially when alternative energy resources are available. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Most of these renewable sources are DC in nature as opposed to traditional AC systems. Coupled with a huge use of DC based equipment in households, it is imperative that the present system be modified to have an optimal and efficient operation. A solution needs to be developed to address this challenging shift from AC to a hybrid system with majority DC. Combining the advantages of AC and LVDC(Low Voltage DC) system a novel hybrid AC/LVDC system with an intelligent centralized micro-grid controller is also discussed previously which aims at giving a feasible solution. The feasibility of any engineering solution is multidimensional and the economics of such is a vital deciding and driving factor for it to be practically implemented and widely accepted. This paper specifically aims to deal with the economic aspects of such a design. It details the analysis of the cost of the new design and compares with the existing traditional system. The paper also deals with the analysis of operational costs in a customer as well as utility perspective to give a lucid picture on the effectiveness of the proposed system.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Port is a focal point especially in the trade sector, where it is represented as hub for the import and export from one destination to another. Despite the fact that it gives positive impact to country specifically in economic sector but from the health sector, this activity leaves a negative impact on the environment and human health, especially those living near the port. Now, most of developed countries have made improvements by converting conventional engines (diesel engines) to electrical engines for major vehicles in ports. The same goes for shore-side ports, most of them using cold ironing (CI). However, all the modification is still raw and faced several challenges, especially in technical aspects such as voltage difference, frequency, supply / demand. It occurs due to the difference in standard voltage and frequency between shore-side and ship. Most of the ocean ship used 60 Hz. In addition, the main constraint faced is that the power supplied on the shore-side is not enough to meet the demand from customers. Thus, to make additions to the existing substation, it will require high initial costs. After evaluating the pros and cons, the new approach is taken to integrate this system into microgrid technology. Microgrid technology is a local cluster energy source with a control capability comprising Energy Distribution Resources (DER), which cover management request, storage, and loads. One of the advantages of a microgrid is that they can be connected or disconnected from the grid to operate autonomously. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Accordingly, modeling and providing energy supply for consumers at an acceptable level of security is vital.

In this study, the preventive maintenance scheduling of multi-energy microgrid is introduced to enhance the resiliency of system in unpredictable circumstances. The proposed formulation intends to make the best use of the profitable levels of freedom related to the maintenance and operational variables by considering the feasible operating region of components. By the use of sequential approach the near-optimal solutions in operation and maintenance schedule is obtained to meet the resiliency requirement. The exact model of electricity and natural gas is adopted to validate the simulation results. Three different cases is examined to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach in standard multi-energy microgrid.

	abstract = {International, national, and subnational laws and policies call for rapidly decarbonizing energy systems around the globe. This effort relies heavily on renewable electricity and calls for a transition that is: (i) flexible enough to accommodate existing and new electricity end uses and users; (ii) resilient in response to climate change and other threats to electricity infrastructure; (iii) cost-effective in comparison to alternatives; and (iv) just in the face of energy systems that are often the result of—or the cause of—procedural, distributive, and historical injustices. Acknowledging the intertwined roles of technology and policy, this work provides a cross-disciplinary review of how microgrids may contribute to renewable electricity systems that are flexible, resilient, cost-effective, and just (including illustrative examples from Korea, California, New York, the European Union, and elsewhere). Following this review of generalized microgrid characteristics, we more closely examine the role and potential of microgrids in two United States jurisdictions that have adopted 100% renewable electricity standards (Hawai‘i and Puerto Rico), and which are actively developing regulatory regimes putatively designed to enable renewable microgrids. Collectively, this review shows that although microgrids have the potential to support the transition to 100% renewable electricity in a variety of ways, the emerging policy structures require substantial further development to operationalize that potential. We conclude that unresolved fundamental policy tensions arise from justice considerations, such as how to distribute the benefits and burdens of microgrid infrastructure, rather than from technical questions about microgrid topologies and operating characteristics. Nonetheless, technical and quantitative future research will be necessary to assist regulators as they develop microgrid policies. In particular, there is a need to develop socio–techno–economic analyses of cost-effectiveness, which consider a broad range of potential benefits and costs. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The high penetration of renewable energy sources in varied types along with the electric vehicles charging demand has created new challenges against the optimal operation and management of these systems. Therefore, this article attempts to formulate, model and operate the renewable microgrids considering different types of renewable sources including solar units, wind units and storages in the presence of electric vehicles. Due to the volatile and random nature of renewable sources and the charging demands by the electric vehicles, it is needed to find a solution for optimal control of these technologies. In this way, a new policy is devised for control of the charging demand in three different schemes, so-called the smart scheme, coordinated scheme and uncoordinated scheme. In order to capture the influence of uncertainties rooting from the renewable sources in the problem, a novel intelligent approach based on fuzzy cloud theory is used which generates an entropy-entropy concept for its task. Through this model, not only the uncertainty of the random variables is handled, but also the uncertainty of the probability density function (PDF) type is also deployed. In order to solve the problem, a swarm optimization based on honeybee mating algorithm (HMA) is proposed which is equipped by the polar search operators for making a symmetrical searching frame. The simulation results on a typical renewable microgrid test system advocate the quality and appropriate efficacy of the model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

The current industry practice is to utilise local harmonic current and reactive power compensation methods, however, local compensation methods are not practical for large MMG system with widely dispersed non-linear loads, because each non-linear load would require its own compensator. To overcome this problem, a novel compensating technology called a series-shunt network device (SSND) is installed between a pair of microgrids in the proposed MMG system. The SSND reduces the number of local compensators required while also performing additional functions in comparison with conventional devices. For effective control of the SSND, an improved model predictive control (MPC) algorithm, which gives better tracking accuracy and faster setpoint change than that of a conventional proportional-integral controller, is also presented. Analysis and simulations verify the capability of SSND in performing both local and non-local active compensation of harmonic current and reactive power in the proposed MMG system under various test scenarios. Simulation results show that the MPC-controlled SSND can achieve effective compensation, thereby resulting in a very low current total harmonic distortion value of 2.4% and a unity power factor at the distribution grid side. © 2020 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {Among different technologies, the Wave Energy Conversion (WEC) represents an efficient, clean and sustainable source for generating electricity, however creating distributed generation plants with Wave Energy Potential (WEP) necessitates extremely careful estimation. Therefore, a new model using five components of Fourier series has been presented for WEP estimation. The model helps reduce the imprecision in the wave estimation due to the time resolution of wave data, permits to emulate the buoy movement when a wave reaches it (hydrodynamics studies), facilitates in the emulation of the linear electric generator magnets movement located inside a powerbouy system (electromagnetic simulations) and helps obtain the correct generated voltage curve shapes and power quality with the aim of designing and selecting the electrical components to connect the microgrid by wave power to the power system. The model is a function of significant height and periodicity of the waves and offers an evidence for a better WEP estimation. Irregular wave profile is very important to predict the voltage and power quality supplied by the powerbouy. When the irregular wave profile is ignored, WEP estimations could exceed 90% and produce false expectations of electric power generation and incorrect sizing of electric components for the microgrid by wave power. Thus, true WEP estimation can prove to be a good investment decision tool to develop wave energy plants. For proposed model validation, the results of an assessment of wave energy in 25 different geographic coordinates of the Mexican coast, based on wave motion profile, suggest that the Mexican Pacific side is suitable for wave power plant development, 100–500 kW for each installed powerbouy in such points. Consequently, this work contributes to obtaining new techniques in WEP estimation based on wave parameters in order to get electrical parameters for true electrical power. Thus, search for technological development for the electrical equipment is required to install for its harvest in wave microgrid system. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The advancement in the field of electrical paradigm accelerated the research towards accepting a new era of technology that would be self-sufficient and high in reliability. Microgrid (M G) is the potential state of the art technology that can disseminate the controlled power to the world. Conservation voltage reduction (CVR) is the viable concept applied in the distribution sector for many years and it is the most promising scheme to curtail the power consumption. The voltage deduction within the permissible standards smoothly runs the electrical grid without disturbing the comfort of the consumer. The application of CVR in the stand-alone MG is considered to be a prospective approach and hence, the power saving phenomena are investigated in the paper with the deduction of voltage parameter. The voltage of the stand-alone MG is being scaled down with the application of the V-I droop method and further, it directly influences the power consumption which shows the potential of demand side management (DSM). In addition, the validation of the controller is being done through 5 bus microgrid test system and the proposed scheme is justified by comparing it with the conventional P-f/QV droop scheme. The performance of DSM enabled controller is tested on MATLAB/Simulink software. © 2021 IEEE.},

For this purpose, a new SI-IT2-fuzzy PD/fuzzy PI (SI-IT2-FPD/FPI) controller is designed on two levels. Initially, an improved whale optimization algorithm, called IWOA, is adopted to adjust the setting of the gains embedded in the FPD/FPI section effectively. Then, the impact of the footprint of uncertainty (FOU), to offer extra design freedom, on control surface generation of SI-IT2-FLC has been investigated. In this way, various control surfaces were generated by varying a single coefficient which forms the FOU. Lastly, by adopting hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator, the feasibility and usefulness of the suggested framework are verified from a real-time perspective. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a comprehensive review of microgrids frequency control by using the Virtual Inertia (VI) is presented. Due to the widespread penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs) and distributed generators (DGs), a new system stability issue has been recently emerged. This issue is associated with the reduction and variation of inertia in the microgrid that is triggered by the utilization of power electronics interfaces to connect the RESs and DGs into the system. This leads to a higher system uncertainty requiring more complex system operation and control. To maintain microgrid reliability and to provide efficient use of RESs and DGs, the synthesis and control of virtual inertia should be a key technology to achieve a flexible operation in current and future microgrids. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the fundamental aspects of synthesis and control of the virtual inertia for microgrid control. More specifically, an overview of the low inertia issue in microgrids with a high share of RESs and the role of virtual inertia are highlighted. Moreover, this paper reviews the role of battery energy storage system (BESS), as one of the novel VI emulated techniques, in enhancing system inertia. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Technology advancement for renewable energy resources and its integration to the distribution network (DN) has garnered substantial interest in the last few decades. Integrating such resources has proven to reduce power losses and improve the reliability of DN. However, the growing number of these resources in DN has imposed additional operational and control issues in voltage regulation, system stability, and protection coordination. Incorporation of various types of distributed generators (DG) into DN causes significant changes in the system. These including new fault current sources, new fault levels, a blinding effect in the protection scheme, reduction in the reach of relays, and decrement in the detection of low-level fault currents for existing relays. Such changes will jeopardize the effectiveness of the entire protection scheme in the DN. This research aims to propose a robust protection scheme in which the relay coordination settings are optimized based on the network layout. The potential impacts of DGs on the DN are mitigated by utilizing a user-defined overcurrent-based relay characteristic to obtain the minimum operating time while satisfying protection coordination constraints. A hybrid optimization algorithm based on Metaheuristic and Linear Programming that has the capability to attain the optimal solution and reduces computational time is proposed in this work. The performance of the proposed technique is tested on radial DN integrated with microgrid (MG). The results obtained show the proposed technique has successfully reduced the relay operating time while meeting the protection coordination requirements for dynamic operating modes of a network.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Secondly, based on the multi-agent system, a distributed control framework is presented. The Leader-Follow consensus algorithm is the solution of optimization model, and the incremental cost of distributed generator (DG) and energy storage is selected as the consensus variable.

For the aim of electrifying each and every house in India and as well as in the world, the development of microgrid systems is a must. It allows access to electricity in remote areas and also encourages the use of non-pollutant energy resources with the help of energy storage technology and other control techniques. The control aspects are to be given more importance for a reliable power supply, and the use of renewable resources such as distributed generation gives a chance for sustainable microgrid systems. Stability issues are also discussed in brief only, but more research is needed on stability issues, too.

	abstract = {Due to the sheer global energy crisis, concerns about fuel exhaustion, electricity shortages, and global warming are becoming increasingly severe. Solar and wind energy, which are clean and renewable, provide solutions to these problems through distributed generators. Microgrids, as an essential interface to connect the power produced by renewable energy resources-based distributed generators to the power system, have become a research hotspot. Modern research in the field of microgrids has focused on the integration of microgrid technology at the load level. Due to the complexity of protection and control of multiple interconnected distributed generators, the traditional power grids are now outmoded. Microgrids are feasible alternatives to the conventional grid since they provide an integrating platform for micro-resources-based distributed generators, storage equipment, loads, and voltage source converters at the user end, all within a compact footprint. A microgrid can be architected to function either in grid-connected or standalone mode, depending upon the generation, integration potential to the main grid, and consumers' requirements. The amalgamation of distributed energy resources-based microgrids to the conventional power system is giving rise to a new power framework. Nevertheless, the grids' control, protection, operational stability, and reliability are major concerns. There has yet to be an effective real-time implementation and commercialization of micro-grids. This review article summarizes various concerns associated with microgrids' technical and economic aspects and challenges, power flow controllers, microgrids' role in smart grid development, main flaws, and future perspectives. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The current transformation of power systems is aiming towards distributed source integration and general decentralization. Renewable energy sources and support of local energy supply create conditions for widespread use of new technologies and smart grids. As the electrical grids become more electrically independent, the importance of frequency control will rise. Stability of the system in such cases is no longer only relying on rotating inertia of generators as in the centralized grid. This known scenario has already been analyzed by many with computational models for optimal safety precautions of the grid. This paper aims to update the common home appliance frequency characteristics through measurements and compare them to those currently used. These devices were divided into two groups: general categorization and light sources. Subsequently, the frequency sensitivity coefficients were evaluated and analyzed home appliances were sorted into three categories according to the size of their frequency sensitivity coefficient values: positive, negative, and no effect. The results were compared with studies aimed at evaluating the static load characteristics. A simplified simulation of the frequency control, presented in the discussion section, was carried out to determine the consequences of the newly measured characteristics and concludes the paper. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Nowadays, emerging modernized microgrids (MMGs) have significantly employed the voltage-source inverters (VSIs). VSIs are enabling technologies to form multi-infeed ac/dc (MIACDC) power systems integrating a variety of generation units and different loads into one coherent grid. In emerging MMGs, the frequency-dependent dynamics of multiple components affect the PQ-controlled, grid-connected VSIs (GC-VSIs), particularly when integrated into a weak network. In order to address this challenging problem, the full integration of the dynamics of the phase-locked loop (PLL) into those of GC-VSIs is accomplished in this research via an innovative modular structure to improve the VSI's performance. This action is expected to significantly reduce the effect of the ac-side dynamics on the control of GC-VSIs. In addition, there are uncertainties associated with the parameters in the system. Accordingly, mismatched disturbances and uncertainties (both matched and mismatched ones) will appear in a nonlinear dynamic problem, and therefore, from the standpoint of control theories, mismatched disturbances and uncertainties should be overcome. Satisfying them is a difficult task in control of nonlinear systems. Therefore, one of the main contributions of this work is finding an appropriate mathematical model of GC-VSIs in the dq -frame for the problem under study. Afterward, in order to control both active and reactive power independently, this article presents a novel two-degree-of-freedom (2DoF) methodology with an enhanced modular design. It combines the sliding-mode control with a 'new sliding manifold' and a disturbance observer with a 'new adaptation rule' taking care of uncertainties and mismatched disturbances. Those disturbance signals may be generated by the PLL dynamics or voltage signals affecting the GC-VSI's dynamics. Through providing mathe- matical analyses (including stability assessments via various theorems using Lyapunov stability criterion), simulation results, and experiments, this article demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology. The industrially accepted GC-VSI equipped with an LCL -filter is used here.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper gives a comprehensive insight into gas microturbine (GMT) as a part of microgeneration systems. The gas microturbine is a highly effective source that can operate on various types of fuel, including a low-percentage methane fuel such as biogas or landfill gas. The microturbine is widely used in an industrial, rural and commercial application that can benefit from combined heat and power production as a prime or backup source. A microgrid is a modern way to support decentralised power production. It can operate in off-grid mode or as a tool to stabilise the grid and help with peak-shaving as well as to supply remote areas with generated power. The combination of gas microturbine as a prime mover for the microgrid is a smart solution that can quickly react and implement renewable and new technologies. The GMT can be coupled with solar photovoltaics, wind turbine, fuel cells or combustion engines. Use of these technologies can create a sophisticated, stable and highly effective power system. Based on the findings, the combination of microgrid and gas microturbine is very viable and favourable in terms of efficiency, controllability, stability and variety of applications. This paper provides a survey in the field of gas microturbine, its operation, industrial applications, software for microturbine integration, microgrid operation, and coupling the microgrids with gas microturbines, as well as possible challenges and perspectives for this area of combined power generation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Regarding the advances in technology and anxieties around high and growing prices of fossil fuels, government incentives increase to produce cleaner and sustainable energy through distributed generations. This makes trends in the using microgrids which consist of electric demands and different distributed generations and energy storage systems. The optimum operation of microgrids with considering demand-side management increases efficiency and reliability and maximize the advantages of using distributed generations. In this paper, the optimal operation scheduling and unit commitment of generation units installed in a microgrid are investigated. The microgrid consists of technologies based on natural gas that are microturbine and phosphoric acid fuel cell and technologies based on renewable energy, including wind turbine and photovoltaic unit along with battery energy storage system and plug-in electric vehicle commercial parking lot. The goal of the paper is to solve a multi-objective problem of maximizing revenues of microgrid operator and minimizing emissions. This paper uses an augmented epsilon constraint method for solving the multi-objective problem in a stochastic framework and also implements a fuzzy-based decision-maker for choosing the suitable optimal solution amid Pareto front solutions. This new model implements the three type of the price-based and incentive-based demand response program. It also considers the generation reserve in order to enhance the flexibility of operations. The presented model is tested on a microgrid and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model economically and environmentally compared to other methods. © 2020 by the authors.

To optimize the use of energy resources and have a more sustainable energy processes, a new formulation is proposed in this paper to optimize the energy consumption of water-energy systems at a community scale. More specifically, single-objective, bi-level, and co-optimization models are developed to minimize the energy consumption of a micro water distribution network concerning three scenarios: (1) standalone operation; (2) integrated with a grid-connected micro energy system with no storage unit; and (3) integrated with an off-grid micro energy system with storage units. In all conditions, a mixed integer nonlinear programming formulation is used to solve the optimization problems. Pump operations with varying statuses, flow rates, and speeds are contemplated to formulate the energy consumption of the micro water, considering a quadratic function for the pump's energy head changing with flow rate. The micro water network is designed based on a diurnal pattern of water demand for a network including 1 reservoir, 1 water tank, 6 nodes, and 2 pumps. The micro energy system includes a microgrid with a combined heat and power plant (CHP), diesel (DS) generator, natural gas (NG) generator, renewable sources (solar and wind), and energy storage units.

	abstract = {Globally, around 1.1 billion people do not have access to electricity and 84% of the population who do not have modern energy access are living in rural and remote areas of developing countries. Since the loads are far from the grid and providing the connection by extending from the main grid requires a high investment associated with long and costly transmission and distribution lines, addressing the problem requires innovative solutions. Therefore, off-grid microgrid systems, using solar photovoltaic and storage systems, integrated with very high-efficiency lighting appliances, are a promising solution to supply energy for rural and remote location in areas which lack access to the electric grid. This paper presents an overview on the existing solar photovoltaic technologies for off-grid systems including the most recent plug and play solutions. A characterization of the most common strategies used for control, communication and metering of microgrids is presented, as well as the recent evolution of the associated component technologies. The security and protection systems used to protect the system against theft or robbery of the systems itself or energy theft in remote areas are also addressed. Additionally, a resumed characterization of the sociologic profile and motivation of people to damage off-grid systems is presented. An overview on the main off-grid appliance market evolution and efficiency trends, in terms of energy efficiency, is also addressed in this paper. Finally, a set of recommendations to promote cost-effective systems is made, considering the market evolution path and the large growth potential of off-grid systems. There is an urgent need to reduce the total system costs, namely the soft costs of new microgrid systems in order to further accelerate the market growth, as well as widely accepted open standards to regulate and develop the market. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Water availability is increasingly stressed in cities across the world due to population growth, which increases demands, and climate change, which can decrease supply. Novel water markets and water supply paradigms are emerging to address water shortages in the urban environment. This research develops a new peer-to-peer non-potable water market that allows households to capture, use, sell, and buy rainwater within a network of water users. A peer-to-peer non-potable water market, as envisioned in this research, would be enabled by existing and emerging technologies. A dual reticulation system, which circulates non-potable water, serves as the backbone for the water trading network by receiving water from residential rainwater tanks and distributing water to households for irrigation purposes. Prosumer households produce rainwater by using cisterns to collect and store rainwater and household pumps to inject rainwater into the network at sufficiently high pressures. The smart water grid would be enabled through an array of information and communication technologies that provide capabilities for automated and real-time metering of water flow, control of infrastructure, and trading between households. The goal of this manuscript is to explore and test the hydraulic feasibility of a micro-trading system through an agent-based modeling approach. Prosumer households are represented as agents that store rainwater and pump rainwater into the network; consumer households are represented as agents that withdraw water from the network for irrigation demands. An all-pipe hydraulic model is constructed and loosely coupled with the agent-based model to simulate network hydraulics. A set of scenarios are analyzed to explore how micro-trading performs based on the level of irrigation demands that could realistically be met through decentralized trading; pressure and energy requirements at prosumer households; pressure and water quality in the pipe network. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Today, the microgrid is not a new concept, and its diverse benefits for the grid and also consumers have been proven. One of the effective ways to enhance penetration level of the microgrids is to improve economic affordability. This can be achieved by defining an optimal investment plan which has been studied for the several past decades. Previous researches have been proposed a model which used a set of typical values as input parameters of the components. As a result, the optimization results may not be fully implementable in practice. In this regard, this paper proposes a new planning model for a hybrid AC–DCmicrogrid which selects the best technology from a set of commercial models already available in the market in addition to optimally selecting the size (number) of each equipment. Among the microgrid equipment, this capability is considered for storage batteries and wind turbines considering their variety of parameters and market models. The proposed model, while linear, takes into account the various parameters of the equipment in addition to the reliability and emission constraints. Results of implementing the proposed model on a test case demonstrated that outputs of the proposed model are more applicable to real practical projects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The concept of microgrid has quickly developed in this modernized grid, aided by several key advances in renewable energy and battery energy storage systems. This has led to the rise of the Prosumer model of electricity usage, wherein a user does both: produce and consume energy. Guided by these factors the peer to peer energy transfer mechanism is slowly developing into a proper grid architecture. This paper aims to show the development of a clustering algorithm for connected entities in a system such that there is an optimal use of battery energy storage systems and renewable energy. For this purpose a system with several connected prosumer entities is chosen. The clustering algorithm is then deployed which clusters the entities in a manner that the subgroup is almost self-sufficient and also has an efficiently performing battery storage system.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, with the promotion of new energy vehicles and micro-grids, energy storage technology has achieved considerable development. The hybridization of the lithium-ion batteries with ultra-capacitors can effectively improve the power capability of the energy storage system, which is suitable for the vehicle and micro-grid applications. High precision modeling is the foundation of the state estimation and energy management of the energy storage system. The fractional-order model provides applicable computational complexity and accuracy. This paper presents the experimental study of the fractional-order models used for lithium-ion batteries and ultra-capacitors. In this work, the experimental results of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of both lithium-ion batteries and ultra-capacitors are systematically analyzed. Then the temperature compensating fractional-order models of the batteries and ultra-capacitors are developed. Moreover, the particle swarm optimization based global optimization is proposed for on-line parameter identification with strict constraints. Therefore the parameters of the fractional-order models can be extracted from daily vehicle operating conditions. Finally, the accuracy of the presented model is proved by dynamic cycle conditions at different temperatures. The results indicate that the proposed method can well approximate the voltage of both the lithium-ion batteries and the ultra-capacitors with mean relative errors less than 4% and 3%, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Power markets are undergoing structural alterations in accordance with emerging technologies. Traditional market rules and participants' behaviour are currently dominated by conventional power plants and synchronous generators. Renewable energy sources have gradually found their market share in the generation party specifically in developed countries. Apart from new energy resources, Demand Response Programs (DRP) have garnered attention due to substantial capabilities and potentials. This paper particularly sheds light on two flexible loads of Plugin Electric Vehicles (PEV) and cooling/heating responsive loads. PEV parking lots can be modelled as stochastic battery storages partially available for power exchange over short intervals. Besides, cooling/heating systems are naturally shiftable loads in short time horizons without deteriorating the resident's convenience. This study provides a comparative view of short-term power regulating markets in terms of bidding constraints and payment mechanisms. Consequently, a typical park & ride is considered as a reconfigurable urban microgrid to participate in short term regulating markets under different constraints. The results confirm that the internal coordination between the sub-units of microgrid brings more flexibility to enhance the total profitability. In addition, it is shown that the bidding constraints, as well as time slots, can be influential particularly in intermittent situations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Particularly, this brief is applied a precise model of the tidal power generation system for the SLFC in the stand-alone MG. Moreover, in order to reduce the cost of energy storage (ES) devices in the MG, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology has utilized as a new idea to overcome this difficulty. Hence, a fractional type-2 fuzzy P+ID controller is applied to have a robust balance between generation and demand. Furthermore, it is quite clear that optimal tuning of the controller's parameters can cause a significant effect on the performance of the whole of the system. Consequently, a new heuristic optimization algorithm, entitled sine-cosine, is used to find the best value of the proposed controller's parameters. Finally, by using real-data, the performance and robustness of the suggested controller over other controller techniques have examined by the dSPACE real-time simulator. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

The positioning of non-conventional renewable energies has endorsed the integration of distributed generation and with this the spread of electrical microgrids. These systems must face multiple operational challenges, which are more complex than those of traditional power systems. The development and maturity of devices based on power electronics and their connection to the electric grids make possible to improve the performance of microgrids in operational terms. In this sense, the microgrid resilience is a topic of major concern which has not been widely developed.

This paper proposes a hybrid AC/DC main urban power Grid and Microgrid interconnection architecture based on a new Energy Router topology and its coordinated control strategy as the basic module of future urban power Grid. In this paper, considering the current situation of land resource shortage in the central area of the city, the new energy generation and energy storage technologies represented by photovoltaic building integration and electric vehicles are considered and connected to the urban distribution network in the form of integrated Microgrid. Considering that the electricity production and consumption patterns of adjacent Microgrids may be greatly different, the interconnection architecture between the main power grid and the Microgrid can be constructed. So in this paper, the Energy Router integrated with AC and DC double busbar and four voltage source inverter, coordinated control strategy is a blend of PQ control strategy and V/f control strategy, based on the disturbance observation method of MPPT control strategy of photovoltaic power generation and the control strategy of energy storage system, it not only make full use of new energy, but also effectively ensure the quality of electricity supply.

	abstract = {This study presents an optimal power management for a microgrid (MG) in distribution market environment. The MG operator is able to have interactions with the distribution market operator (DMO) and adjacent MG (AMG) operator to supply its local loads. The DMO regulates the electricity market, and assigns the electricity price and power profile for the MG. The motivation behind the use of The DMO is that it works as an entity between MG and independent system operator (ISO) in order to guarantee a flexible operation by reducing power fluctuation and reduce the unintentional peak loads in low market price hours. The unused power capacity in AMG is used during the islanded hours through an additional interconnection point connected to the MG. Using this method reduces the need for installing new generation resources, which will be a practical and economical solution for MG developer. This MG which is able to provide power from distribution market and the AMG with two interconnection points is named dependent MG (DMG). A market-based stochastic model containing distribution market constraints and AC power flow formulations employs conditional value at risk (CVaR) methodology to capture the loads and wind uncertainties. The effectiveness of the presented model is evaluated on a 20 kV test system using different case studies. In this test system, the operator is the owner of all generation units. The numerical analysis explicate that presented model reduces the operation cost of DMG with the aim of responsive loads, unused power capacity, energy storage system (ESS) and power generation units. The market-based scheduling also provides operational flexibility for distribution system by adjusting flexibility limit of market constraints. It is also shown that changing risk preferences level changes the power generation pattern in ESS and causes a costly operation of resources in risk-averse strategy. The competence of this model is significant when the preventive maintenance (PM) program is carried out, and the DMG should rely on its flexible resources and AMG's available power capacity, which could reduce the load shedding. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Thus, a fuzzy random economic scheduling model considering dual uncertainty of EV is proposed for islanded EV-source-storage-load microgrid. The uncertainty of EV discharge response is characterized by fuzzy membership function, and the parting model of SOC initial value is established by probability theory, thus a hybrid opportunity-constrained programming model with both fuzzy and random parameters is constructed based on credibility measure. The genetic algorithm combined with fuzzy random simulation technology is given to calculate the operation cost of EV microgrid under different operation conditions. The simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed method, in which the operation cost is reduced clearly than other several scenarios. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The decision-making process for the optimal bidding strategy of microgrids (MGs), which suffer from the surplus power due to the high penetration of the intermittent resources, is not without challenge. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a new approach for determining the optimal bidding strategies for the MG modified by the renewable resources in the day-ahead energy and spinning reserve markets using the capacities of the power to hydrogen (P2H) and hydrogen storage (HS) technologies. To fulfill this aim, the unscented transformation has been used to model the uncertainties related to renewable resources, load consumption and electricity price in the entity in an efficient way. The findings reveal that the cost of operating the system without energy storage is 779$ while by using an energy storage system (ESS) it is reduced to 741$ which shows a 4% reduction in the costs. Also, by using ESS as both energy and reserve suppliers, the cost of operating becomes 640$ indicating an 18% reduction. However, using HS system reduces the operational cost as much as 26% and 40% for energy supplier and both energy and reserve suppliers, leading to 577$ and 487$, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Various multi-energy carriers are utilized to form energy hubs which exchange energy with each other and the main electricity and gas networks. The proposed model considers renewable generation, diesel generators, fuel cells, energy storages, combined heat and powers, boilers, combined cooling heat and powers, and power to gas converters. The seasonal load patterns are considered to design the optimal capacity of combined cooling, heating, and powers. The main objective of the proposed model is to operate the integrated hubs with minimum cost, meet the consumer's required energies, reduce the emissions, and create a bi-directional interaction between electricity, and gas networks using power to gas converters. While all electrical, mechanical, and technical constraints are satisfied. To achieve these improvements, industrial and residential hubs interact with other multi-carrier microgrids to determine the optimal operation of hubs. The proposed model is tested on a standard case study and results show when hubs integrate about the total daily cost of each microgrid has been improved about 200 $. Besides, the thermal energy not supply in microgrid 4 has been improved from 4.61 MWh to 0.45 MWh. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A growing number of households benefit from government subsidies to install renewable generation facilities such as PV panels, used to gain independence from the grid and provide cheap energy. In the Romanian electricity market, these prosumers can sell their generation surplus only at regulated prices, back to the grid. A way to increase the number of prosumers is to allow them to make higher profit by selling this surplus back into the local network. This would also be an advantage for the consumers, who could pay less for electricity exempt from network tariffs and benefit from lower prices resulting from the competition between prosumers. One way of enabling this type of trade is to use peer-to-peer contracts traded in local markets, run at microgrid (G) level. This paper presents a new trading platform based on smart peer-to-peer (P2P) contracts for prosumers energy surplus trading in a real local microgrid. Several trading scenarios are proposed, which give the possibility to perform trading based on participants' locations, instantaneous active power demand, maximum daily energy demand, and the principle of first come first served implemented in an anonymous blockchain trading ledger. The developed scheme is tested on a low-voltage (LV) microgrid model to check its feasibility of deployment in a real network. A comparative analysis between the proposed scenarios, regarding traded quatities and financial benefits is performed. © 2020 by the authors.},

But the high-permeability photovoltaic (PV) generation system and a large amount of charging loads from EVs will have negative impacts on the economic and safe operation of distribution networks. The grid-connected PV-and-storage microgrid integrating with EVs is one of the effective solutions. In this paper, for dealing with the problem of energy storage optimization in grid-connected PV-and-storage microgrid, the concept of third-party microgrid operator is introduced at the microgrid side, and the net present value (NPV) model of microgrid is established to evaluate the feasibility of microgrid's project investment and operation; the technology acceptance model (TAM) is introduced to the EV's owners side to evaluate the long-term acceptance of demand side response technology for EV owners by assessing demand-side response technology's perceived usefulness and perceived easy of use. The calculation example shows that the establishment of TAM can comprehensively judge the willingness of the EV's users to operate demand-side response, and forecast more practically the amount of the charging loads of EVs; The grid-connected PV-and-storage microgrid integrating with EVs' demand side response can reduce the amount of excess solar electricity effectively and improve the NPV in microgrid's project period. © 2020, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica.

	abstract = {The high growth of the automotive industry reveals the very bright future of this technology and its high penetration effects on the human society. No doubt that the random and volatile charging demand of these devices would affect the power grid optimal operation and scheduling which may be regarded as a new challenge. Therefore, this paper investigates the stochastic scheduling of hybrid AC/DC microgrids considering the plugin hybrid electric vehicles charging demands, distributed all over the grid. Three different charging patterns, called coordinated, uncoordinated and smart charging models with different characteristics for the charger type, capacity and market share are proposed. Moreover, different types of renewable energy sources including wind turbine, solar panel and fuel cell are modeled and considered in the scheduling process of the hybrid microgrid. In order to mitigate the charging effects of electric vehicles on the hybrid AC–DC microgrid operation, some remotely switches are considered in the system which make it possible for changing the topology and power flow way. In order to model the uncertainty effects, a data-driven framework based on point estimate method and support vector machine is developed. This would make it possible to extract out the standard deviation value of the uncertain parameters and reflect their impacts on the microgrid operation problem through the limited concentration points. A novel evolving solution based on flower pollination algorithm is also proposed to solve the problem optimally. An IEEE standard test system is used as the hybrid AC/DC microgrid case study to assess the performance of proposed model. © 2020},

	abstract = {In the deregulated electricity markets, trading prices are determined by the offer-demand mechanism, and retail consumers can negotiate tariffs with their supplier of choice. For classic wholesale suppliers, the tariffs are determined by the prices of transactions performed on the wholesale market. In parallel with becoming eligible for participating in the market, the consumers use increasingly local generation sources based mostly on renewable electricity generation equipment such as Photovoltaic (PV) panels, and become prosumers. They want to be able to sell back to the market the generation surplus, in order to obtain the maximum benefits from their initial investment. This paper proposes a two-tier local market model oriented for prosumers and consumers connected in microgrids, based on the blockchain technologies and other technologies and concepts such as smart grids, crowdsourcing and energy poverty. Its goals are to improve the possibilities of local prosumers to sell electricity to local consumers and to increase their profitability, compared to the trading model often used in developing markets, of selling the surplus back to the grid via aggregators. The research aims to contribute to the sustainable development of the electricity sector using new and renewable sources of energy, state-of the art technologies and smart contracts, leading to prosumer proliferation and electricity cost reduction for consumers. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The steady decline in the prices of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed renewable generation and storage systems, together with more sophisticated monitoring and control strategies allow power distribution companies to enhance the performance of the distribution network, for instance improving voltage control, congestion management, or reliability. The latter will be the subject of this paper. This paper addresses the improvement of continuity of supply in radial distribution grids in rural areas, where traditional reinforcements cannot be carried out because they are located in secluded areas or in naturally protected zones, where the permits to build new lines are difficult to obtain. When a contingency occurs in such a feeder, protection systems isolate it, and all downstream users suffer an interruption until the service is restored. This paper proposes a novel methodology to determine the optimal location and size of micro-grid systems (MGs) used to reduce non-served energy, considering reliability and investment costs. The proposed model additionally determines the most suitable combination of DER technologies. The resulting set of MGs would be used to supply consumers located in the isolated area while the upstream fault is being repaired. The proposed methodology is validated through its application to a case study of an actual rural feeder which suffers from reliability issues due to the difficulties in obtaining the necessary permissions to undertake conventional grid reinforcements. © 2020 by the authors},

	abstract = {In modern power networks, DC microgrid is a promising technology because it facilitates the easy interface of renewable sources, energy storage systems, and electric loads. However, the protection schemes used in conventional AC distribution are not viable for DC systems, since, the DC distribution system needs much faster fault detection compared with conventional AC grid. Therefore, in this paper, an impedance relay is proposed for detection and location identification of faults in a Low Voltage DC (LVDC) microgrid. The proposed scheme uses a parallel combination of inductance and capacitance that is connected in series with each cable for inserting a high-frequency component in the fault current. The impedance relay placed on the distribution cable measures the impedance value at this inserted high frequency. Depending on the measured value of impedance, fault location is estimated and the discrimination between external and internal faults can be carried out. The modeling of the aforementioned Low voltage DC microgrid is performed in PSCAD/EMTDC environment. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme is able to detect and locate the faults accurately and rapidly in comparison to the other existing schemes. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the increasing penetration rate of distributed generation in microgrid and the growing maturity of its technology, the participation of a large number of proconsumers brings new opportunities and challenges to the energy transaction in microgrid. In the new form, the traditional centralized energy transaction method has the problems of low transaction efficiency, high maintenance cost, low privacy, low information security coefficient, low information transparency and so on. Therefore, an energy transaction method of microgrid based on blockchain technology is proposed. Firstly, the exchange method of microgrid energy ownership and tokens based on blockchain system is used to guarantee the information privacy and transaction data security of both parties. In the blockchain information system, the proconsumers and consumers trade energy ownership and tokens, and their rights and interests are protected by smart contracts. Then, a consensus mechanism based on credit is proposed, which takes the credit value as the basic attribute of microgrid nodes and takes the mining reward probability of the credit value impact nodes to restrict the behavior of nodes in microgrid. Finally, the auction mechanism-based energy matching method and consumer's bidding strategy are put forward. Proconsumers within the microgrid sell surplus electricity and consumers initiate bidding for proconsumers' electricity according to their own needs. The auction mechanism and valuation strategy are used to stimulate rational bidding of consumers, so as to improve the internal consumption of microgrid and maintain the balance between supply and demand within the microgrid. The example results show that the proposed energy transaction method can be used to conduct multilateral bidding transactions, improve the self-consumption within the microgrid effectively, ensure the economic benefits of the microgrid, and guarantee the safe operation of transactions. © 2020, Electric Power Automation Equipment Press.

The blockchain technology is characterized by a distributed architecture without a trusted and centralized authority, and, therefore, it appears as the perfect solutions for managing exchanges between peers. In this paper, a market algorithm that can be easily transferred to a smart contract for maximizing the match between produced and consumed energy in a micro-grid is presented. The algorithm supports energy transactions between peers (both producers and consumers) and could be one of the main executables implemented using a blockchain platform. The case study presented in this paper shows how the end-users through the blockchain could select among the possible energy transactions those more suitable to offer specific ancillary services to the grid operator without involving the grid operator itself or a third-party aggregator. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There is a huge pervasive consideration of integrating renewable energy sources (RES) to DC power system. Most of the modern loads are DC. Photovoltaic (PV) integrated DC microgrids feature remarkable advantages such as providing DC which can be directly utilized in DC grids that eliminates major step of AC-DC conversion. However, intermittency of RES and presence of some non- idealistic like voltage fluctuation, droop effect, faults and harmonics causes instability problems in DC microgrid. This leads to voltage weakening, potential blackout and damage to equipment. To deal with inconsistency and improbability of RES new emerging demand side management (DSM) technology has been developed called Electric Spring (ES). ES can be employed in AC or DC grid for supply-demand management. DC Electric Spring (DC-ES) is a unique method of distributed voltage control over traditional single point control by effectively handling supply. This paper comprises one of the types of DC-ES called the shunt DC-ES for voltage regulation and Fault Ride Through (FRT) support with various mode of operation on DC bus. To demonstrate the performance analysis and to alleviate DC microgrid issues, DC-ES is implemented on 48V DC system. Moreover, the detail comprehensive characteristics behavior of shunt DC-ES is presented and validated using MATLAB software.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microgrids can effectively gather various renewable resources for increasing the profit of the system, as well as the trend toward improving energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the energy and reserve scheduling of microgrids will be significantly sophisticated due to the inherent uncertainty and variability of such resources. To address the operational challenges associated with these new technologies, this paper introduces an innovative stochastic cost-emission based scheme for optimal simultaneous energy and reserve scheduling of a renewable-based microgrid in the look-ahead energy market aimed at maximizing social welfare of microgrid as well as minimizing environmental emissions. Besides, the time of use program is accompanied by the model to optimize the procurement costs of the microgrid. The conditional value-at-risk method is also incorporated into the problem to hedge the microgrid in confronting the risk of exposure to the uncertainty. The proposed problem is formulated as a computationally efficient multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming through augmented epsilon-constraint technique and is solved using an off-the-shelf solver. Finally, a realistic case study with the integration of renewables and energy storage devices is conducted. The results evidenced that the proposed algorithm can properly immunize microgrid against uncertainties and participation of demand-side flexibility not only significantly reduces operational costs, but also changes the dispatching patterns of controllable distributed generations and prevents non-renewable resources to be stand-by only for providing reserve. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microgrids are emerging as an alternative mode of operation for distribution systems integrated with Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). With appropriate management and control of the DERs, a section of a distribution system can operate isolated from the main grid thereby enhancing the reliability and security of supply to consumers. However, the integration of DERs has raised many technical challenges including protection. The traditional distribution system protection cannot provide reliable protection to the microgrid in the isolated mode due to the limited short-circuit capacities of the converter-interfaced DERs. This paper proposes the application of a new voltage-based relay type for the protection of microgrids. The relay algorithm achieves its protection function through active power differential and sensitivity calculations based on voltage measurements within a specified protection zone. In the paper, the new relay type is modelled in Digsilent PowerFactory software and installed at the nodes of a microgrid test system. The performance of the relay type is investigated under variety of faults. The relay is shown to operate correctly and effectively to detect and identify faults in both radial and meshed microgrids integrated with inverter-interfaced DER technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microgrids are important parts of modern strong intelligent power system. In recent years, new energy sources have developed rapidly in China, and research on microgrid technologies is in the ascendant. The typical microgrid has obvious advantages such as flexible network structure and small circuit loss. With its increasing scale and increasing application in the power system, it needs to be dealt with the complex operation mode. In order to achieve efficient operation and management, microgrid control still needs to be equipped with energy management system (EMS). One of the main problems that EMS needs to solve is the generation of massive alarm information within a short period of time after equipment failure. To this end, this paper proposes a microgrid alarm processing method based on equipment fault prediction and improved support vector machine learning. Based on historical operation risk and health state evaluation, the equipment fault prediction is carried out. Then we optimize and select kernel function for machine learning and have an improved SVM model. With this model, fault equipment sets are classified and verified so we can get the accurate source alarm and fault equipment. Finally, the validity and accuracy of this method are verified by a simple example.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to formulate the most probable future scenario for the use of blockchain technology within the next 5–10 years in the electricity sector based on today’s experts’ views. Design/methodology/approach: An international, two-stage Delphi study with 20 projections is used. Findings: According to the experts, blockchain applications will be primarily based on permissioned or consortium blockchains. Blockchain-based applications will integrate Internet of Things devices in the power grid, manage the e-mobility infrastructure, automate billing and direct payment and issue certificates regarding the origin of electricity. Blockchain solutions are expected to play an important big role in fostering peer-to-peer trading in microgrids, further democratizing and decentralizing the energy sector. New regulatory frameworks become necessary. Research limitations/implications: The Delphi study’s scope is rather broad than narrow and detailed. Further studies should focus on partial scenarios. Practical implications: Electricity market participants should build blockchain-based competences and collaborate in current pilot projects. Social implications: Blockchain technology will further decentralize the energy sector and probably reduce transaction costs. Originality/value: Despite the assumed importance of blockchain technology, no coherent foresight study on its use and implications exists yet. This study closes this research gap. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Variable distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar and wind are rapidly becoming common in low-inertia microgrids (MGs) worldwide as the world explores cost-efficient and sustainable energy solutions. Additionally, the urgent need for greenhouse gas emission reductions and the availability of vast renewable energy resources serve as motivations to harvest these renewables. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is one of the most utilised due to the significant drop in prices for solar PV systems. However, the variable nature of solar PV generation due to cloud movements introduces rapid ramp events thus affecting power system management. Nowcasting, which is defined as very short-term solar irradiance forecasting, together with controllable DERs, can be integrated into MGs to possibly address these ramp events and enable an increase in PV penetration levels in MGs. This study outlines the benefits and limitations of nowcasting and its applications in the control of MGs obtained from a survey. From the survey, it was evident that sky camera-based nowcasting technology is still new but has potential in MG applications. Applications of nowcasting in MGs included ramp rates control and scheduling of spinning reserves. Additionally, PV penetration levels may be increased if nowcasting tools are incorporated into the control of MGs. However, the main barrier impeding the utilisation of sky camera-based nowcasting technology is the lack of experience and lack of demonstrated reliability. © 2020 IEEE},

This paper presents a mixed-integer linear-programming (MILP) model for the enhancement of the resilience of distribution systems (DSs) through the optimal MGs formation with simultaneous allocation of dispatchable DG. The radial MGs are formed via reconfiguration, for this purpose, a new radiality set of constraints is proposed. On the other hand, modern DSs incorporate several DG technologies, thus, a master-slave DG operation is considered where the large existent dispatchable DGs are master units with voltage control while photovoltaic, batteries, and new allocated dispatchable DGs are slave units. Uncertainties in photovoltaic and load behavior are considered via stochastic scenario-based approach. Numerical results based on a real 135-node DS validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Future generation or smart grid (SG) will incorporate ICT technologies as well as innovative ideas for advanced integrated and automated power systems. The bidirectional information and energy flows within the envisaged advanced SG together with other aiding devices and objects, promote a new vision to energy supply and demand response. Meanwhile, the gradual shift to the next generation fully fledged SGs will be preceded by individual isolated microgrids voluntarily collaborating in the managing of all the available energy resources within their control to achieve optimality in both demand and distribution. In so doing, innovative applications will emerge that will bring numerous benefits as well as challenges in the SG. This paper introduces a power management approach that is geared towards optimizing power distribution, trading, as well as storage among cooperative microgrids (MGs). The initial task is to formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and ultimately decompose it into a formulation that jointly considers user utility as well as factors such as MG load variance and associated transmission costs. It is deduced from obtained analytical results that the formulated generic optimization algorithm characterizing both overall demand and response by the cooperative microgrids assist greatly in determining the required resources hence leading to cost effectiveness of the entire system. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Future power system has unique characteristics different from the former and present ones. In order to support main technical features of future power system especially for high renewable energy penetration, function and morphology of future power system are proposed. Considering the significant influence of technology development and value formation, the evolution driving force of future power system is proposed from the aspects of both technology innovation and value reconstruction. The evolution principle of power system is also presented. In Section I, change of outer surrounding of power system is investigated and requirement for future power system is discussed. In Section II, influence of technology innovation on future power system is presented. The key power transmission and distribution technology can be divided into four categories including traditional long-distance transmission technology, new type of substitutive long-distance transmission technology, transmission auxiliary technology suitable for large-scale renewable energy integration, power distribution and utility technology supporting distributed generation and micro-grid connection. For each category, technical feature and present situation are investigated. The developing trend is forecasted. Then influence on future power system is proposed. In Section III, concept and theoretical scheme of value reconstruction are presented. The input variable of scheme is defined as dispersed resources with potential value, while the output variable is defined as innovation benefit and competitive advantage of enterprise. By using three key steps including value identification, value creation and value implementation, the goal of value reconstruction is achieved. The goal of value reconstruction of future power system is proposed from four viewpoints. The first one is value reconstruction from providing traditional energy service to integrated energy service. The second one is value reconstruction from providing domestic energy service to global energy service. The third one is value reconstruction from focusing on single energy industry to cross-industry. The fourth one is value reconstruction from definition as a traditional enterprise to latest type of platform enterprise. Value reconstruction of future power system will drastically affect the function and morphology of future power system, including to promote the upgrade of domestic power system, to expedite global energy interconnection, to stimulate multi-network convergence, and to accelerate enterprise strategic transformation, which is also related to the value implementation step(the third step) in the presented value reconstruction scheme. In Section IV, function and morphology of future power system is proposed. Then, morphology of future Asian power grid is forecasted. An analytic hierarchy process model for the decision making of interconnection mode is established. The mathematical solution of the analytic hierarchy model shows the DC grid mode is the most probable mode for the interconnection of the Asian power grid in the future. Furthermore, evolution principle is presented. It is found that evolution of future power system is affected by the level of technology innovation as well as the process of value reconstruction, in which the former one is the external power, and the latter one is the internal pressure. Considering the usage efficiency and life cycle of stock assets, evolution of future power system should not be drastic, but there should be great continuity and coherence among each stage. In Section V, the theoretical and specified analysis results are concluded. © 2020 IEEE.},

A key component of battery-driven peak shaving optimizations is peak forecasting, which predicts the hours of the day that see the greatest demand. While there has been significant prior work on load forecasting, we argue that the problem of predicting periods where the demand peaks for individual consumers or micro-grids is more challenging than forecasting load at a grid scale. We propose a new model for peak forecasting, based on deep learning, that predicts the k hours of each day with the highest and lowest demand. We evaluate our approach using a two year trace from a real micro-grid of 156 buildings and show that it outperforms the state of the art load forecasting techniques adapted for peak predictions by 11 - 32%. When used for battery-based peak shaving, our model yields annual savings of $496,320 for a 4 MWhr battery for this micro-grid. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Attempts have been made to enhance the smartness of a campus from various perspectives such as obtaining real-time statistics on reduction in energy consummation, increased percentage of power generation from renewable resources, improved campus traffic flow, air quality, and monitoring buildings health etc. However, to the best of our knowledge a comprehensive list of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for smart campus and smart microgrid is yet to be developed. In this work, we study smart cities, smart microgrids, city ranking systems, and literature on smart campuses for extracting a list of relevant KPIs as well as propose new KPIs where needed to support the main business process of a university campus. Accordingly, 74 KPIs have been listed which are measurable, achievable, relevant, and time phased. We divide these KPIs among 15 service areas consisting of smart microgrid, smart buildings, intelligent transportation, economic growth, smart governance, propagation model, pollution & waste management, climate resilience, water resource management, financial sustainability, entrepreneurial leadership, enhanced teaching and learning, security and privacy mechanisms, health care provision, and public participation. In addition, we present an example of a university campus from energy consumptions and carbon footprint perspectives. We also highlight the need for long distance, low power communication architecture to support 2-way communication of microgrid and infrastructure with devices installed at remote locations. The aim of this work is to establish a mechanism that allows campus management to monitor the smartness of their university campus in general, and microgrid in particular. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {While the concept of microgrids and renewable energy systems is not entirely new, these integrated technologies have become a special topic of interest for researchers, utility providers and governments. Many challenges must be overcome to achieve better integration of renewable sources into the energy framework. This study presents some viable possibilities for the utilisation of a hybridised microgrid system. The hybridisation is achieved by an efficient design approach for the enhancement of both load and system reliability indices through the intelligent placement and sizing of hybrid distributed generation (DG) systems. Real-time models of solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, batteries and thermal DGs are presented and implemented. Also, network component failures are stochastically modelled via Monte Carlo simulations, and a general tie-set algorithm using an adapted breadth-first search is proposed. Moreover, mixed-integer multi-objective particle swarm optimisation is employed, giving a four-dimensional Pareto solution that is attained by optimising four reliability-related objectives, namely system average interruption frequency index, System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI), Energy Not Supplied (ENS) and total cost. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019},

However, the integration of new concepts in distribution networks, such as microgrids, distributed generation, energy storage etc., introduces various challenges regarding the energy management procedures. This paper proposes an optimal coordination model of multiple microgrids in smart distribution networks, based on a two-level optimization scheme. The upper-level of the proposed model optimizes the distribution network operation, while the economic dispatch is calculated in each microgrid in the lower-level of the methodology. Two scheduling modes are analyzed for the microgrids operation: independent grid-connected scheduling and coordinated scheduling mode. The influence of the microgrids scheduling on the distribution network operation is investigated using the test IEEE 33-bus system, modified with three microgrids, each including loads, controllable generators, renewable sources, and energy storage systems. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Energy systems face great challenges from both the supply and demand sides. Strong efforts have been devoted to investigate technological solutions aiming at overcoming the problems of fossil fuel depletion and the environmental issues due to the carbon emissions. Hybrid (activated by both renewables and fossil fuels) distributed energy systems can be considered a very effective and promising technology to replace traditional centralized energy systems. As a most peculiar characteristic, they reduce the use of fossil sources and transmission and distribution losses along the main power grid and contribute to electric peak shaving and partial-loads losses reduction. As a direct consequence, the transition from centralized towards hybrid decentralized energy systems leads to a new role for citizens, shifting from a passive energy consumer to active prosumers able to produce energy and distribute energy. Such a complex system needs to be carefully modelled to account for the energy interactions with prosumers, local microgrids and main grids. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of a hybrid distributed energy system serving an urban community and modelled within the framework of agent-based theory. The model is of general validity and estimates (i) the layout of the links along which electricity is distributed among agents in the local microgrid, (ii) electricity exchanged among agents and (iii) electricity exported to the main power grid or imported from it. A scenario analysis has been conducted at varying the distance of connection among prosumers, the installed capacity in the area and the usage of links. The distributed energy system has been compared to a centralized energy system in which the electricity requests of the urban community are satisfied by taking electricity from the main grid. The comparison analysis is carried out from an energy, environmental and economic point of view by evaluating the primary energy saving, avoided carbon dioxide emissions and the simple payback period indices. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The evolution of the building automation and control systems (BACS) systems presents the challenge of defining new concepts for a clear and unambiguous definition of functionalities. While for traditional electrical systems it is possible to unequivocally infer functionalities from wiring diagrams and component characteristics, in BACS systems this may not be so immediate. A comprehensive description of the functionalities of such systems may require additional descriptors, so as to also consider logical connections among devices, as well as their configurations. Designers of BACS systems must therefore become familiar with software that may be used to properly express the logic functionalities of the system, and be able to provide system integrators with pertinent details for the hardware settings. In BACS, a logical layer (setting and addressing) is superimposed on a physical layer (wiring). The logical layer determines the functionality of the system. Software should allow the implementation of networks parameters with any communication standards (e.g. KNX, proprietary systems, etc.) and be transparent to the designer. This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art in BACS, and examines major parameters that may be universally applicable to both KNX systems, as well as to proprietary systems with gateway (e.g., Xiaomi, Google Home, etc.). BACS is one of the most important enabling technologies for the creation of microgrids for smart buildings and energy communities. © 2020 IEEE.},

Proper control and monitoring requires a state estimator that can adapt to the new technologies for DC microgrids. This paper mainly deals with the DC microgrid state estimation (SE) using a modified long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which until recently has been applied only in forecasting studies. The modified LSTM network for the proposed state estimator adopted a specifically weighted least square (WLS)-based loss function for training. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed state estimator, a comparison study was done with other SE methods included in this paper. The results showed that the proposed state estimator had high accuracy in estimating the states of DC microgrids. Other than the enhanced accuracy, the deep-learning-based state estimator also provided faster computation speeds than the conventional state estimator. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Direct current (DC) power system is an upcoming technology promising technology in the existing world with certain advantages like high efficacy, flexibility and simple integrated to clean sources as compared to AC systems. This paper presents a low-voltage (LV)-DC micro-grid protection system. The LV-DC micro-grid consists of interconnects distributed resource like photovoltaic (PV) and sensitive electronic loads. Compared to AC micro-grid system the DC micro-grid is a new emerging field, so one main issue with DC micro grid is the protection. So, different control schemes of fault detection and protections are used of DC micro-grid for a well-functioning power system operation.

	abstract = {Network reconfiguration is an effective strategy for different purposes of distribution systems (DSs), e.g., resilience enhancement. In particular, DS automation, distributed generation integration and microgrid (MG) technology development, etc., are empowering much more flexible reconfiguration and operation of the system, e.g., DSs or MGs with flexible boundaries. However, the formulation of DS reconfiguration-related optimization problems to include those new flexibilities is non-trivial, especially for the issue of topology, which has to be radial. That is, the existing methods of formulating the radiality constraints can cause under-utilization of DS flexibilities. Thus, in this work, we propose a new method for radiality constraints formulation that fully enables the topological and some other related flexibilities of DSs, so that the reconfiguration-related optimization problems can have extended feasibility and enhanced optimality. Graph-theoretic supports are provided to certify its theoretical validity. As integer variables are involved, we also analyze the issues of tightness and compactness. The proposed radiality constraints are specifically applied to post-disturbance MG formation, which is involved in many resilience-oriented DS service restoration and infrastructure recovery problems. The resulting new MG formation model, which allows more flexible merge and/or separation of the sub-grids, etc., establishes superiority over the models in the literature. Demonstrative case studies are conducted on two test systems. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The emerging blockchain technology has injected new vitality into the energy market, especially the peer-to-peer power trading of microgrid systems. However, with the increase of energy blockchain projects, the difficulty of data communication and value islands between blockchain networks have become open issues. Thus, in this paper, we propose a dynamic adaptive cross-chain trading mode for multi-microgrid joint operation. The novelty is to design a proof of credit threshold consensus mechanism to achieve effiective information verification. This consensus mechanism can ensure the adaptive consistency of cross-chain information without changing the existing blockchain architecture of each system. At the same time, we design a corresponding key management interoperability protocol based on RSA algorithm and Chinese remainder theorem, which can realize data transfer and information consensus for cross-chain transactions. The theoretical analysis verifies that the cross-chain communication information is effiective and the system is able to protect against the attack of malicious nodes. Finally, a cross-chain simulation experiment is established to analyze the operation efficiency. The result shows that this cross-chain trading takes place within seconds, which basically meets the response requirements for multi-microgrid joint operation. © 2020 by the authors.

The resulting unified time scale intelligent control algorithm better realizes the combined functions of 'droop control + automatic generation control + economic dispatch' in the traditional opermode.

	abstract = {Background: The smart grid systems with advanced cyber technologies are vulnerable to the false data injection attacks. The attacks will bypass the online state estimation monitoring, steal energy by a false dispatch in the electricity markets, and gain financial benefits. In this paper, the FDI attack case in the electricity markets of a smart grid power system is considered with micro-grids connected. The estimated transmitted power is modified, leading to the change of electricity prices which will bring the benefit to the attacker. Further, influence on the optimization output of energy management for a Micro-grid has been discussed. By trading online electricity with the main grid, the micro-grids are able to maintain power balance and reduce generation cost of the whole smart grid system power system. Then different optimal generation outputs of Micro-grid and total generation cost of the power system are also shown and discussed. Aims: The focus of this paper is to investigate the FDI attack with limited information of the system topology and dynamics, and to discuss the economic impact of such limited attacks, where the estimated transmitted power is modified and the electricity prices are correspondingly changed for benefits. Different optimal generation outputs of Micro-grid and total generation cost of the power system are also shown and discussed. Materials & Methods: MG-based electricity markets model of a SG power system is considered for FDI attacks. Strategy with partial information is proposed from the attack's view. In real-time market, optimization output changes of energy management for a MG when considering the electricity trading are discussed. The quick time detection method is developed with the feature extraction technique for an accurate real-time estimation of the fault detection, when the operator is with partial information of the system topology. Digital signal processing approaches of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are adopted to better extract the time-frequency characteristics of the input transient signals and improve the detection. Results: By considering of the distributed characteristics of MGs and the optimal operation requirements of system, we transformed the problem into a standard stochastic convex program, then solved the problem by the scenario generation method. We used a modified-IEEE standard 14-bus system and an IEEE standard 118-bus system to show the effect of false data injection attacks in electricity prices and the influence of the optimization output of energy management for a MG. We employed modified-online CUSUM algorithm to establish the quickest detection of the attacks. Numerical simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme is robust to the time-varying dynamic system, and is efficient in terms of detection accuracy for the random and structured attacks. Discussion: Modified-online CUSUM algorithm is proposed with wavelet transform and feature extraction method for the quickest detection of the attacks. Numerical simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme is robust to the time-varying dynamic system, and is efficient in terms of detection accuracy for the random and structured attacks. The proposed detectors are also proved to have quick and reliable responses to small attack magnitudes, which are difficult to be detected by traditional CUSUM algorithm. Further, the detection method is employed on IEEE standard 118-bus system to be compared. The simulation results have shown that the proposed model is also adapted to complex system. Conclusion: In this paper, the impact of false data injection attacks on real-time electricity markets of the SG power system with MGs connected is investigated. Attack strategies are designed of worst-case robustness about grid dynamics when the attacker has partial information about the grid, where the attacker can still manipulate nodal prices of the real-time markets and maximize the profit under different degrees of uncertainties. The optimal generation outputs of MGs are discussed for the ability of maintaining power balance of the whole SG power system by trading online electricity. Besides, the detection problem with partial information of the grid topology is also investigated from grid operator's view, and a new modified detection method is proposed to defend FDI attack when considering the existence of the unknown. Modified-online CUSUM algorithm is proposed with wavelet transform and feature extraction method for the quickest detection of the attacks. Numerical simulation results have shown that the proposed scheme is robust to the time-varying dynamic system, and is efficient in terms of detection accuracy for the random and structured attacks. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

	abstract = {Recently, Energy Storage (ES) technologies have a crucial role in the power system. Additionally, increasing loads needs more capacity in the system and accordingly network expansion planning would be required. In this paper two aspects i.e. Microgrid aggregator and Energy Storage (ES) planning are integrated. It goes without saying that installing new ES capacities in the distribution level costs less than constructing new generators so considering ES, energy can be stored during extra production times and used when it is needed such that there is no need to pay for investment cost for new candidate components. Therefore, storing the extra production related to renewable resources is the goal of ES planning in this paper. An ES expansion approach in the presence of Microgrid aggregator is formulized linearly without using any approximation. Moreover, the effect of renewable resources such as wind turbines is considered and the effect of uncertainty related to renewable production in addition to load uncertainty are considered by a new stochastic model.A modified IEEE 6-Bus test system is implemented to illustrate the helpfulness of the presented model.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to transition localized hybrid renewable energy microgrid system in multiple regions by integrating excess renewable electricity and carbon dioxide generated with biogas produced in wastewater treatment plant. The integrated optimization network in this contribution addresses the following aspects: (1) biogas supply-demand distribution network, (2) hydrogen production technology allocation involving steam methane reforming and electrolysis, (3) carbon dioxide allocation, and (4) utilization of external resources. The proposed framework is mathematically expressed as a mixed-integer linear programming problem to minimize total annual cost which will be solved by graphical optimization approach, P-graph. A case study of the existing petrochemical industry complex in South Korea has been applied to the developed model. Feasible configuration for meeting base hydrogen demand (7200 tons H2/year) has been proposed with total annual cost of 75,772,460 US $/year. Apart from base hydrogen demand, the developed model is verified with the increase of hydrogen demand for 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%. Nonetheless, scenario of tight environmental regulations enforcement has been established among all cases where carbon dioxide emitted within the system will be captured and sequestrated. Pareto Frontier Analysis and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) have been implemented to enhance the overall sustainability by re-ranking the pool of near-optimal solutions to propose new sustainable configuration with the consideration of both economic and environmental aspects (i.e., 40% increase of hydrogen demand; Before: 142,579,000 US $/year, 109,933.00 tons CO2/year; After: 142,651,000 US $/year, 109,845.00 tons CO2/year). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Small-scale power generation based on renewable energy sources is gaining popularity in distribution grids, creating new challenges for power system control. At the same time, remote consumers with their own small-scale generation still have low reliability of power supply and poor power quality, due to the lack of proper technology for grid control when the main power supply is lost. Today, there is a global trend in the transition from a power supply with centralized control to a decentralized one, which has led to the Microgrid concept. A microgrid is an intelligent automated system that can reconfigure by itself, maintain the power balance, and distribute power flows. The main purpose of this paper is to study the method of control using reclosers in the Lahsh district of the Rasht grid in Tajikistan with distributed small generation. Based on modified reclosers, a method of decentralized synchronization and restoration of the grid normal operation after the loss of the main power source was proposed. In order to assess the stable operation of small hydropower plants under disturbances, the transients caused by proactive automatic islanding (PAI) and restoration of the interconnection between the microgrid and the main grid are shown. Rustab software, as one of the multifunctional software applications in the field of power systems transients study, was used for simulation purposes. Based on the simulation results, it can be concluded that under disturbances, the proposed method had a positive effect on the stability of small hydropower plants, which are owned and dispatched by the Rasht grid. Moreover, the proposed method sufficiently ensures the quality of the supplied power and improves the reliability of power supply in the Lahsh district of Tajikistan. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The U.S. power grid is undergoing a transformation. Operational focus is shifting away from utilities with large centralized generators at the transmission level and moving toward individual customers who contribute generation from distributed energy resources (DERs) at the distribution level. Utility-scale renewable generation, meanwhile, continues to span across both transmission and distribution networks. The current interconnection process for small- to grid-scale DERs is well-defined, time-consuming and complex. It involves studying every DER application within a network model to identify its impacts on the network, both locally and systemwide. New technologies and applications are expanding the use cases for the capacity analysis approach, which is radically changing how interconnections are evaluated. Rather than focusing on individual DER connections, capacity analysis can allow you to study nearly every possible interconnection scenario. By identifying and understanding the ideal locations and usage times for DERs-and optimizing operating conditions-capacity analysis is making faster approvals and interconnections, as well as higher DER penetration, possible. This presentation will cover recent implementations of capacity analysis performed for Southern California Edison. © 2020 IEEE.},

In this sense, the allocation of dispatchable distributed generation (DG) and the optimal microgrids formation are efficient alternatives to obtain a resilient system. This paper presents a mixed-integer second- order conic programming (MISOCP) model to improve the resilience of the DS by the allocation of dispatchable DG and the optimal formation of radial microgrids including topology reconfiguration. The objective function minimizes the outage of loads after a high-impact and low probability (HILP) incident while the operational constraints are satisfied. Nowadays, in distribution systems several DG technologies are operating simultaneously, thus, the formulation considers a master-slave DG operation where the existent dispatchable generators are masters units while new allocated DGs are in a slave operation. Numerical results based on a real 135-bus distribution system validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2020 IEEE.},

In this paper, a new optimal structured interval type-2 fractional order fuzzy proportional derivative/fuzzy proportional integral controller is proposed for the secondary load frequency control (LFC) of a networked shipboard multimicrogrid. The effect of the various degradation factors associated with the communication infrastructure such as the time delay and packet loss is modeled and addressed to assess the system performance in the networked control system (NCS) operation. The parameters embedded in the established structure are decisive factors, which significantly affect the quality of control output actions. Accordingly, by employing the concepts of the black-hole optimization algorithm and Lévy flight, an enhanced JAYA algorithm is proposed to adjust the setting of the established structured controller. Finally, comprehensive studies and hardware-in-the-loop real-time simulations are conducted to appraise the acceptability of the suggested controller for a secondary LFC problem in the face of the uncertain NCS. © 2013 IEEE.},

Bi-directional power flow, seamless operational transitions in the midst of disturbances and the integration of new technologies are all relevant in modern power systems. To enable such important functionality, we explore new additions to the rectifier and inverter controllers in an AC-AC converter with a topology containing few switches. A self-synchronization technique is used to allow for a more simple synchronization implementation while exhibiting stabilizing behavior. Also, additions will be made to the controller to control the voltage and ripple at the DC stage of the AC-AC converter. An AC-AC converter, with enhancements to its controller, can perform various operations and is hence useful in various scenarios that may be encountered during power system/microgrid operation. © 2020 IEEE.},

To this, two modulation technologies are used based on OFDM (QPSK and 64-QAM) and the results are compared. The communication channel has been designed according to the properties of dispersion, attenuation, and noise, which are found in the applied environment.

Large-scale photovoltaic systems and wind farms may decrease the quality of the electrical grid service, mainly due to voltage and frequency peaks and fluctuations. Besides, new functionalities, such as the operation in islanded mode of some portions of the medium-voltage grid, are more and more required. In this respect, a model predictive control for voltage and frequency regulation in interconnected local distribution systems is presented. In the proposed model, each local system represents a collection of intelligent buildings and microgrids with a large capacity in active and reactive power regulation. The related model formalization includes a linear approximation of the power flow equations, based on stochastic variables related to the electrical load and to the production from renewable sources. A model predictive control problem is formalized, and a closed-loop linear control law has been obtained.

	abstract = {Nowadays, distributed generation technology is of great help to the efficient utilization of new energy. If the distributed power supply is connected to the DC micro-grid, it will be more secure and reliable. Therefore, it is necessary to control the voltage stability of the DC bus and ensure the balance of the source charge power of system to ensure the power supply quality and safety of the DC micro-grid. There are two operation modes of DC micro-grid: connected operation and isolated operation, and isolated operation control is the foundation and key of system-level control of DC micro-grid. To solve the problem of bus voltage fluctuation in isolated dc micro-grid, this study proposes a voltage hierarchical-droop control strategy for DC micro-grid, which can effectively improve the stability of the DC bus voltage. Last, this study builds the simulation model of DC micro-grid in the MATLAB/Simulink platform to verify the validity and feasibility of the proposed control strategy. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.},

	abstract = {Microgrid will become the main mode of power supply for the community in the future, and the development of information technology will make the data of the community microgrid more real-time and transparent, which help improve the demand-side management level of the microgrid. With the cyber-physical-social system (CPSS) architecture, the community microgrid was divided into a three-layer architecture consisting of physical equipment, cyberspace and social roles and a new type of optimization approach was proposed based on guiding cues and parallel control that enables community residents to actively participate in the energy management process of the microgrid. Guiding cues are a series of messages issued by the microgrid operator on the Internet to guide community power users to use renewable energy as much as possible, which make the microgrid more environmentally friendly. Based on the open data in the microgrid, parallel control is a data-driven approach that help the operator reduce the costs of this method and achieve the maximum benefit. The community microgrid operator and power users achieve a win-win situation in this approach, and at the same time the microgrid becomes greener. This paper described the CPSS architecture and operation process of a community microgrid and then expounds on the concept of guiding cues and the application of parallel control, as well as some necessary algorithms. Simulation results that are based on a grid-connected community microgrid demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach proposed. © 2020 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.},

It is estimated that global cities will add another 2.5 billion new residents by the year 2050. However, along with this rapid expansion also arises the need for cities to provide infrastructure support in order to provide their residents with a good quality of life that is both sustainable and environmentally friendly by reducing the carbon footprint. Digital technology can be harnessed to help cities manage their energy needs through the deployment of the smart grid. Blockchain provides a more secure management of energy data while satisfying the energy needs of a smart city of the future. Blockchain aggregators can be deployed at different layers of the smart grid to protect the data flowing on the network. With the increasing popularity of microgrids as components of the smart grid, ‘prosumers’ can use the blockchain to sell their own renewable energy back to the smart grid. The blockchain technology platform can be deployed to protect microgrid data resulting in a more secure power grid system, a necessity to keep today’s digital cities operating cost-effectively, efficiently, and securely. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Due to specific characteristics of electric distribution systems and their high vulnerability against natural disasters, providing appropriate methods for resiliency analysis and identifying system weaknesses is of great importance. Increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) resources and developing microgrid (MG) technology provide modularity to distribution networks. Since the system capability in splitting into multi-independent sub-sections benefits its performance in severe circumstances, the level of modularization can be construed as a measure for resiliency analysis. In this study, a novel framework based on the modularity idea is proposed for quantifying the resiliency level of electric distribution systems. Utilizing graph related theories, a new path-based approach is presented to extract the possible set of formable MGs and their servicing areas. Further, electrical and topological features, switching limitations, and reconfiguration options are also included in the MGs exploration process. Then, by introducing new dependency-based indices and considering various uncertainties, the efficiency of the formed MGs and the impact of disasters on the survivability level of the sections are evaluated. In addition, an efficient approximate approach is developed for implementing the method on large-scale distribution networks. The proposed algorithms have been simulated on several case studies with the results confirming their effectiveness and computability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

To this end, this paper focuses on combined cooling, heating, and power microgrid to alleviate these issues. In this regard, a multi-carrier energy storage system composed of thermal storage system, ice storage system, and hydrogen storage system are integrated into the proposed system to benefit from their techno-economic advantages. The proposed combined cooling, heating, and power microgrid not only participates in power, gas, and thermal market to supply power, thermal, and cooling demands but also can participate in the hydrogen market using a novel power-to-hydrogen technology utilized in the hydrogen storage system to increase the entire system efficiency. Moreover, a multi-energy demand response model is applied as a new concept of demand response on both electrical and thermal loads, which provides more options for multi-energy end-users in energy management policies. Additionally, a novel hybrid robust-stochastic approach is proposed to deal with the uncertainty of wind speed and electricity price fluctuations, which enables the operator to use the advantages of both scenario-based stochastic and robust optimization methods simultaneously to handle such uncertainties. The scenario-based stochastic technique is used to handle the uncertainty of wind speed while the robust optimization method is also considered to manage the uncertainty associated with electricity price in a conservative environment. The main objective of the proposed model is to minimize the operation cost of multi-energy microgrid, which is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a case study and numerical results are provided. Obtained results shows that utilizing hydrogen storage and multi-energy demand response can reduce the system operation cost up to 5% for the studied test system. © 2020},

	abstract = {The new energy microgrid is a new and complex power generation and distribution system. Due to the instability of the new energy wind power generation that constitutes the microgrid, it affects the stable operation of the microgrid. The use of artificial intelligence methods to predict load and wind power generation can improve forecast accuracy, which is beneficial to the energy management and operation optimization of the microgrid. The stable operation of the microgrid is of great significance. This paper takes the new energy microgrid as the research object, and uses artificial intelligence neural network as the technology drive. The short-term load forecasting model and wind power generation forecasting model based on neural network are established. Compared with the traditional forecasting model, the future short-term load and wind power generation are compared respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method is verified by the prediction of the measured quantities. The results show that both the short-term load forecasting method based on neural networks and the forecasting method of wind power generation are suitable for new energy microgrid systems. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The virtual energy storage derived from the controllable load energy regulation is more suitable for the control of the mixed energy storage to suppress the DC voltage fluctuation, and it can provide a new feasible method for improving the operational stability of the DC grid demand side. Firstly, the relationship between rotational kinetic energy of controllable load and charge-discharge energy of energy storage element is established in the process of dynamic change of DC voltage. The definition of virtual energy storage originating from controllable load is proposed, and the virtual energy storage control strategy of controllable load is then designed. Secondly, according to the state of charge of super capacitors, batteries and virtual energy storage components in microgrid, a DC microgrid partition operation control method with virtual energy storage is proposed. The virtual energy storage replaces the mixed energy storage in the set area to undertake the power regulation of the grid and achieve energy coordination and distribution of multiple energy storage components. At last, it is verified that the proposed control method can utilize the rotational kinetic energy reserve in the controllable load to equip the energy storage equipment for the DC grid by constructing the DC microgrid simulation system, which significantly improves the stability of the system DC voltage. © 2020, Editorial Board of Acta Energiae Solaris Sinica.

The blockchain technology and the use of smart contracts for DR allow the creation of a distributed system, in which customers can communicate directly, in a transparent, secure, and traceable way, with the grid operator to provide their flexibility. In this article, the DR problem formulation takes into account several aspects, which are periodically executed. First, the blockchain records customers' energy consumption or production; then, the smart contract starts calculating the baseline and the potential support provided by each customer to fulfill the requested load adaptation. Customers' availability for generation and load profile modulation is also taken into account, as well as their privacy and an updated definition of the roles of grid and market operators in a new DR scenario supported by the blockchain technology. The blockchain used is Hyperledger Fabric, since it turned to be flexible for smart contract implementation while supporting multitenancy. Results show the possibility of successfully applying the blockchain technology to this particular topic, even considering privacy-preserving issues. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

This paper proposes an intelligent energy management scheme to allow different distributed generation sources and energy storage technologies to actively participate in demand response via the deployed smart meter infrastructure. A Distributed Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (D-SMES) device is integrated into the network to deliver instantaneous and large bursts of power to support the grid under short-term disturbances. The proposed demand response-based energy management algorithm receives, via the smart meter infrastructure, the information from the electricity network such as the energy cost, upper load adjustment limit, and the State-of-Charge (SOC) of the storage system then, under very specific conditions, a decision is formulated as a control signal for charging or discharging the storage system, aiming at minimizing the total energy while avoiding any load shedding. The effectiveness of the proposed demand response approach for controlling generation, storage and demand coordination and energy cost reduction is demonstrated on a sample power system simulated in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems toolbox and evaluated under different case study scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, researches have been carried out to develop optimal trading strategies, and many recent technologies are also being used in combination with microgrids. One such technology is blockchain, which works over decentralized distributed ledger. In this paper, we develop a blockchain based approach for microgrid energy auction. To make this auction more secure and private, we use differential privacy technique, which ensures that no adversary will be able to infer private information of any participant with confidence. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity at every trading node, we use consortium blockchain, in which selected nodes are given authority to add a new block in the blockchain. Finally, we develop differentially private Energy Auction for bLockchain-based microgrid systems (DEAL). We compare DEAL with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction scenario and experimental results demonstrates that DEAL outperforms VCG mechanism by maximizing sellers' revenue along with maintaining overall network benefit and social welfare. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology heralds great promise as a demand-side resource to contribute to more efficient grid management and promote the use of decentralized renewable energy. In this light, we propose a new optimization model for the sustainable energy and reserve market management in renewable-driven microgrid (RMG) plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) parking lot systems. The RMG is composed of a hybrid photovoltaic/wind/hydrogen energy and storage system, along with local dispatchable generation units and bidirectional grid connection. The RMG is coupled to a smart PEVs parking lot, which is equipped with grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and V2G technologies allowing for not only PEVs aggregation and control but also optimal allocation of energy resources. Time-of-use (TOU) prices are considered in a demand response program (DRP) to enhance both economic and environmental performances by encouraging end-users to shift their energy demands from peak to off-peak time periods. Additionally, the model accounts for an economic incentive to PEVs owners to compensate for battery degradation. The integrated system eco-efficiency is evaluated through the application of the novel life cycle assessment-based Eco-cost indicator. The resulting mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize sustainability costs is implemented in GAMS and solved to global optimality. Different case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modelling approach. Energy analyses results reveal that the optimal G2V-V2G operation, allied to TOU prices in a DRP, and reserve market management can reduce around 42% the energy and environmental costs of the RMG-PEVs parking lot system. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to balance the two non-compatible objectives, a new differential evolution variant, which is named as SaCIDE-r, was proposed to solve the optimization problem. In this algorithm, a Collective Intelligence (CI) based mutation operator was proposed by mixing some promising donor vectors in the current population. Besides, a self-adaptive mechanism which was developed to avoid introducing extra control parameters. Further, to avoid being trapped in local optima, a re-initialization mechanism was developed. Then, we have evaluated the performances of the proposed SaCIDE-r approach by studying some numerical optimization problems of Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC) 2013 with D =30, compared with seven state-of-the-art DE algorithms. Moreover, the proposed SaCIDE-r method was applied for economic scheduling of a shipboard microgrid under different cases compared with other multi-objective optimizing methods, resulting in very competitive performances. The comprehensive experimental results have demonstrated that the presented SaCIDE-r method might be a feasible solution for such a kind of optimization problem. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to the advancements in the smart grid technologies, smart mechanisms are required within the Energy Management System (EMS) environments for microgrids. One of the functionalities of EMS is to ensure grid stability. In order to test and validate new mechanisms, appropriate simulation tools exist. Most of the existing validation strategies include modeling the target system in simulation environment and then deploying the mechanism in the real environment. When the validated mechanisms are implemented in real environment, they often do not work as intended and require modification due to the implementation difference within the EMS controller. An EMS should be able to communicate with the simulated model, inject faults in the simulated model and able to perform various control actions. In this paper, we propose a software-in-loop approach, where the grid stability mechanisms are implemented in the EMS, which is deployed in the real environment. EMS must operate exactly the way it does in the simulation environment. For such a capability, the simulation platform should be able to communicate with the EMS. In this work, we consider a 13-node radial distribution grid with one solar panel as a generation unit. The 13-node distribution grid has been modeled using Apros simulation software. SMG2.0, a software application for microgrid is used to monitor, inject electrical faults and trigger recovery mechanisms in the Apros model. A communication architecture called ICT gateway has been developed between Apros and the EMS (SMG2.0). Two fault scenarios (line-breakage and under-voltage) are considered as the fault injection scenarios to evaluate the performance of the communication architecture. When the SMG2.0 detects a line fault, it triggers network reconfiguration as the recovery strategy for the line-breakage scenario in the simulation environment. This approach not only helps in designing fault handling strategies in the electrical network but also helps in designing an effective software application targeted to control the physical entities. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Uncertainties of renewable power generation, load, and electricity price imposes serious challenges in optimal scheduling of microgrids (MGs). To cope with this issue, advanced models should be developed to optimize scheduling problem of MGs under uncertainties. However, the optimality and robustness of solutions as well as the computational burden are still a matter of concern when applied to scheduling of a practical MG. To provide a model which is adjustably robust and computationally tractable and also financial effective at the same time, this paper proposes a novel uncertainty handling framework based on stochastic p-robust optimization method for day-ahead scheduling of MGs including renewable and non-renewable distributed generations, combined heat and power systems, energy-storage systems, as well as demand response providers. The objective is to find optimal scheduling of MG in a way that the expected profit is maximized while the regret in each scenario is bounded. The effectiveness of the proposed model is tested on a MG test system thorough different case studies. Simulation results demonstrate that the robustness of the scheduling results is enhanced significantly without substantial decrease in the expected profit of MG. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The microgrid is integrated to 3 phase 4 wire AC distributing network, feeding power to the mixed load (the combination of three phase load and single phase load) connected at the point of interconnection (PIC). The microgrid improves the supply reliability at the consumer end by working in both grid connected and islanded modes. A new adaptive control algorithm is proposed to control the microgrid in grid connected mode. The proposed control algorithm delivers the extracted power from the solar PV array at the PIC and also resolves the power issues caused by the load behavior. In standalone mode, synchronous rotating frame (SRF) theory-based algorithm is used to control the microgrid. In this mode, the microgrid maintains the rated voltage at the PIC so that load is not be disturbed.

This work demonstrates how an EMS based on a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy can perform better improving the accuracy of the load forecasting algorithm. To that aim a novel approach is presented, that is characterized by the correlation between real time and historical consumption data. The technique has been tested for over a year of operation. Three test cases have been compared (low error load forecasting, higher error load forecasting and correlation-corrected load forecasting) and techno-economic advantages have been obtained with the new approach. Indeed, a reduction of 14,1% in energy unbalance with the grid and of 8,7% in annual operational costs have been obtained when the load forecast correction is performed. Moreover, the critical components of the system (Electrochemical Energy Storage and Fuel Cell) result to work in less stressful operating conditions, another positive effective of the technique. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The rise of large-scale HVDC transmission technology has introduced new requirements for dynamic reactive power compensation in power systems. The new generation of synchronous condensers is independent of grid voltage and does not need to be dragged by a coaxial prime mover, which can improve the dynamic reactive power compensation of the power grid. This new generation of synchronous condensers is dragged by the static frequency converter to a 105% rated speed, after which the static frequency converter logs out. In the process of idling, the excitation mode switching is completed and the unit is connected to the grid simultaneously. The synchronous device passively captures the connection-dot in the process of idling; as a result, increasing the grid-connection success rate and reducing the impact of grid connection become a pair of contradictions. In this paper, the boundary conditions of the new generation of synchronous condenser grid-connection systems are analyzed. These provide the basis for setting the synchronous device parameters. Furthermore, this paper proposes an optimized grid-connection strategy to ensure the new generation of synchronous condensers possesses good grid-connection characteristics. © TÜBİTAK},

An energy storage system such as a battery or other energy storage technologies used in hybrid microgrids with multiple distributed generations (DGs) is considered. Optimal utilization of the storage system is to select the optimum location, determine the optimum capacity and optimal charging and discharging planning. The optimal operation of the storage system used in the hybrid microgrid is challenging due to uncertainties in various system parameters. The optimization problem in this paper is a nonlinear and non-convex problem, therefore ordinary problem solving methods such as linear programming are inapplicable. On the other hand, uncertainty of load, weather conditions and energy storage system can have a significant impact on the problem of optimal operation of the storage system. Moreover, a new optimization algorithm named stochastic quasi-gradient method (SQGM) is utilized in order to optimize the nonlinear and non-convex objective function under load uncertainty. Simulation results on a typical hybrid microgrid confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2019 IEEE.},

The V2G technology allows the microgrid to take advantage of temporal arbitrage in the electricity market, and hence, improve economic viability of electric vehicles. We present both a mathematical model and a custom solution methodology for this problem. The proposed stochastic model is a very large-scale mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, and thereby, we develop an algorithm that provides high-quality solutions. A case study for 14-node and 37-node microgrid test systems for a planning horizon of five years is presented, and a thorough sensitivity analysis for effects of uncertainty, investors preferred payback period, market price fluctuations and electric vehicles arrival and departure rates is discussed. The simulation results show that investing in the V2G technology can considerably improve the long-term economics of the microgrid, but the obtained profit and the payback period can vary from one plan to another. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, the power quality problem of micro grid cannot be ignored. In this paper, the power quality of micro grid is taken as the research object. Through understanding the basic structure of micro grid, the power quality of micro grid is analyzed, and the impact of voltage sag on micro grid is obtained. Based on the characteristics of power transmission, the difference between droop control in micro grid and that in traditional large power grid is analyzed. Because the droop control has the problem of voltage and frequency offset, especially in the isolated operation of micro grid, over migration directly affects the stability of the system. In this paper, the restoration control of voltage and frequency is adopted to guarantee the stability of the whole system. Then, the simulation of the control strategy studied in this paper was completed based on MATLAB/Simulink simulation software, which verified the feasibility of the control method studied. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper is motivated by the need to ensure fast microgrid stability. Modeling for purposes of establishing stability criterion and possible implementations are described. In particular, this paper proposes that highly heterogeneous microgrids comprising both conventional equipment and equipment based on rapidly emerging new technologies can be modeled as purely electric networks in order to provide intuitive insight into the issues of network stability. It is shown that the proposed model is valid for representing fast primary dynamics of diverse components (gensets, loads, and PVs), assuming that slower variables are regulated by the higher level controllers. Based on this modeling approach, an intuitively appealing criterion is introduced requiring that components or their combined representations must behave as closed-loop passive electrical circuits. Implementing this criterion is illustrated using a typical commercial feeder microgrid. Notably, these set the basis for standards that should be required for groups of components (subgrids) to ensure no fast instabilities in complex microgrids. Building the need for incrementally passive and monotonic characteristics into standards for network components may clarify the system level analysis and integration of microgrids. © 1969-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart cities are a complicated blend of Information and communications technology (ICT) as well as Internet of Things (IoT) from physical (such as sensors and actuators) and non-physical (such as external databases) data sources. The smart physical data sources contribute to developing the level of safety and security of citizens' daily life through different smart solutions such as optimization for autonomous power grids and human health applications. Those physical devices generate a massive amount of data that is necessary for analytic applications to be applied in user services. Cloud computing technologies utilize as a centralized ICT architecture to collect the massive amount of data from all scale of the city and build the citizens' services by developers. However, several challenges in cybercrime and cybersecurity exist in Cloud computing technologies as well as large scale IoT environments and smart cities. Those challenges are i) the new generation of the attack on an IoT network is to create a problem with the availability of IoT data for the Cloud applications by overwhelming devices with information requests; ii) complex communication and computation resource constraints has a big concern to moving forward to detect attack at the edge of networks. Therefore, heading off the threat of cybercrime in large scale IoT and smart cities calls for a new study on designing cybersecurity models for ICT architecture. In this paper, we first present our fully hierarchal Distributed-to-Centralized ICT (D2C-ICT) architecture for the Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN) center in the context of the smart cities. Second, we propose two different novel anomaly detection models by using the contribution of Fog to cloudlet and Cloud technologies through our presented D2C-ICT Architecture in the context of the smart city. Finally, we discuss two different use cases for attack detection. We envisage that we can enhance the level of attack detection techniques through different technologies of the D2C-ICT from edge to Cloud networks. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The development of microgrids is of great interest to facilitate the integration of distributed generation in electricity networks, improving the sustainability of energy production. Microgrids in DC(DC-MG) provide advantages for the use of some types of renewable generation and energy storage systems, such as batteries. In this article, a possible practical implementation of an isolated DC-MG for residential use with a cooperative operation of the different nodes is proposed. The main criterion is to achieve a very simple design with only primary control in a residential area. This application achieves a simple system, with low implementation costs, in which each user has autonomy but benefits from the support of the other users connected to the microgrid, which improves its reliability. The description of the elements necessary to create this cooperative system is one of the contributions of the work. Another important contribution is the analysis of the operation of the microgrid as a whole, where each node can be, arbitrarily, a consumer or an energy generator. The proposed structures could promote the use of small distributed generation and energy storage systems as the basis for a new paradigm of a more sustainable electricity grid of the future. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {One of the most important issues in power grids is the outage problem that occurs due to weaknesses of the power system infrastructure or the occurrence of human or natural faults in the power system. The issue of complete deletion of power outages is unlikely due to unpredictable nature of major faults. After a fault, it is necessary to isolate the fault location as soon as possible. Thus, the energy path may be interrupted to some of the loads. However, new technologies or advanced methods can be used to reduce the interruptions duration. By appearance of smart grids and developing its level of intelligence, it is possible to automatically detect a fault in the shortest time, isolate it from the system and feed healthy parts of the system on a different path. The set of automatic activities that occur after a fault occurrence to achieve previous goals is called self-healing. In other words, Self-healing of the distribution system means changing the distribution network structure after fault in order to feed disconnected loads while maintaining the network’s electrical constraints. Undoubtedly, self-healing is one of the main abilities of the smart grids with respect to traditional systems to automatically retrieve system after fault occurrence or keep away system from critical conditions. Self-healing usually consists of three steps: fault location, isolation and system restoration (FLISR). The large number of lines, branches, and equipment of the distribution network can complicate this process. In this chapter, definition, requirements and challenges of self-healing are introduced and various approaches which have been recently proposed by researchers are assessed. Also some tools and methods like demand response, load shedding, distributed energy resources and autonomous microgrids which can facilitate self-healing process are assessed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {At present, the world economy as a whole stress the need for sustained and quality services in all sectors. Most industries are dependent on electricity and different electrical equipment and, as a result, maintaining energy quality has become a major issue for all industries to flourish and profitably. The Distribution Static Synchronous Compensator (D-STATCOM) is an advanced device-based power electronics device that can be used to control the power flow of distribution lines.Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) is an advanced, intensive computational PWM method. In this paper, SVPWM technology based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is used to avoid the computational complexity used in traditional implementations. The integral proportional controller is adjusted by means of a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to improve the response performance of the switch angular. In the design of the PSO algorithm, adjust the Pi controller parameters kp and ki, so that the switching angle can achieve the best parameter values.PSO is required to determine the optimal switching angle while maintaining the base voltage, which can reduce some of the higher harmonics. To promote this technology, it can be extended to multi-stage inverters. When any loading effect, the structure of the system can be introduced to restore the bus voltage, and the control algorithm using the PSO controller effectively control the amount of power without problems under fault conditions. The simulation results show that the new D-STATCOM based on SVPWM can achieve better control and improve system efficiency. © 2019 IEEE.},

This concept has been geared up with the increased penetration of renewable energy sources. In order to securely control the load demand, with the intermittent behavior of the integrated renewables, a well-established communication infrastructure is therefore crucial to effectively coordinate between different components in the power grid. IoT is an emerging technology that is integrated in this project to provide wireless communication of a DC smart microgrid and thereby reduce wires used in the system. This technology, however, has not been applied in Egypt yet. To this end, this paper provides the design and the experimental validation of an IoT-based sensing system using a prototype dc micro grid, as a part of a senior project for electromechanical engineering undergraduate students. The design of different system components is introduced, and the experimental validation is carried out under different scenarios including healthy as well as contingency conditions. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Interconnected microgrids are becoming a building block in smart systems. Initiating secure and efficient energy trading mechanisms among networked microgrids for reliability and economic mutual benefits have become a crucial task. Recently, integrating blockchain technologies into the energy sector have gained significant amount of interest, e.g. transactive grid. This paper proposes a two-layer secured smart contract-based energy trading mechanism to allow microgrids to establish coalitions, adjust the electricity-trading price, and achieve transparent and decentralized secure transactions without intervention of a third trusted party. Since reliability benefits are main drivers of microgrids operation in islanded mode, a new decentralized smart contract based-energy trading model for islanded networked microgrids is proposed in the first layer with an objective to achieve demand generation balance. In the second layer, and to achieve a higher security, all executed contracts are verified and saved in a blockchain based on a new developed two-phase consensus method that utilizes practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT), and a modified Proof of Stake (PoS). Simulations are conducted in Python environment to validate the proposed energy trading model.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, new types of generation technologies have emerged and have been gradually integrated into the existing power systems, moving their classical architectures to distributed systems. Despite the positive features associated to this paradigm, new problems arise such as coordination and uncertainty. In this framework, microgrids constitute an effective solution to deal with the coordination and operation of these distributed energy resources. This paper proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to address the combined problem of Unit Commitment (UC) and Economic Dispatch (ED). With this end, a model of a microgrid is introduced together with all the control variables and physical constraints. To optimally operate the microgrid, three operation modes are introduced. The first two attend to optimize economical and environmental factors, while the last operation mode considers the errors induced by the uncertainties in the demand forecasting. Therefore, it achieves a robust design that guarantees the power supply for different confidence levels. Finally, the algorithm was applied to an example scenario to illustrate its performance. The achieved simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {A smart city provides a high quality of life to its inhabitants through optimal management of its resources. By definition a smart city is equipped with smart infrastructure that provides improved quality of life with sustainable environment through smart built solutions. In their operation, smart cities would entail a highly reliable, energy efficient, and high-quality power; smart grid becomes obviously imperative. Energy management is demanded within such urban centers due to the complexity of the energy systems and their important role. Mathematical simulation and predictions are the major tools commonly used to assess the technological and policy impacts of smart solutions. Distributed energy systems can be represented in the form of microgrids and combined heat and power. As cities are developed to become smarter, energy form and access to it become consequently even more integral part of modern living forms. Newer energy systems must also be transformed to become increasingly more reliable and resilient. Solar cells and wind energy technologies remain the best candidates in terms of new major energy sources in smart cities even with their dependence on natural processes. These energy sources should remain the future backbone of smart energy systems. In fact, solar panels for practical applications in buildings have made such substantial jumps since their inception a few years ago that prices have remarkably dropped worldwide. However, the transition to a fuller solar-wind energy economy arrives with a drastic set of challenges, including inherent inefficiencies in current energy battery storage capabilities. This is particularly apparent in the transport sector, which has the most trouble when anticipating its energy transition. Considering the unavoidable intermittent nature of wind and solar energy supply within a day, week, month, traditional centralized power production, and distribution are questionable. If unchanged, it will be more difficult to maintain a robust energy provision. The integration of wind and solar into practical energy system in cities demands significant investment. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Trading of the generated energy has recently been improved by blockchain technology which offers a new cheap, secure, and decentralized transaction approach. Its operation is however associated with an undesired inherent delay during energy transactions initiated by the prosumers, thus, failure to timely attend to incidences of urgent demand could end up in catastrophe at the consumer's side. This article thus proposes a cyber-enhanced transactive microgrid model using blockchain technology with optimized participants' permission protocol to ameliorate this challenge. It is demonstrated that the optimized blockchain participants' permission model leads to improved transaction speed and greater convenience. The transaction speed simulation is thereafter performed and it was also demonstrated that the node population has a greater effect than the transaction block size on the transaction speed improvement.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Interpolation in the overset domain connectivity information for a cell-centered CFD flow solver will typically use a least square procedure to determine the interpolation weights. The weights produced using the least square procedure are not bounded between zero and one. Thus the interpolation can be non-monotonic and introduce new extrema in the solution, which can cause difficulties with the CFD solution. Interpolation using a dual grid, which connects primal cell centers to form dual grid cells, can be used with tri-linear interpolation to produce weights bounded between zero and one. Forming the dual grid for a structured grid is trivial since the connectivity between cell centers is implicit. For an unstructured grid the dual grid connectivity must be generated. This paper investigates the use of tetrahedral meshing technology to form a tetrahedral unstructured dual grid. The first approach uses a global dual grid where a single grid connects all cell centers, which can be expensive to store. The second approach investigated uses a set of local dual grids where each primal grid element has an associated local dual grid that is independent of neighboring local duals. The local dual grid can reduce memory requirements by loading only the set of local dual grids required for interpolation. Compressible CFD solutions using the least square interpolation weights are compared with solutions using the global dual grid interpolation weights. These results show that the non-monotonic interpolation using the least square interpolation weights can cause solution instabilities. Clipping the interpolated values obtained by using the least square weights will force the interpolation to be monotonic and solution stability is preserved. The CFD solution is stable when using the dual grid interpolation weights as expected. For the configurations and conditions considered in this investigation the solution results using the dual grid interpolation and the clipped least square interpolation show only minor differences. © 2020, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

	abstract = {This paper addresses the costs and benefits associated with microgrid development relative to the costs and benefits of conventional generation interconnected to a bulk transmission and distribution grid. The costs and benefits are classified as: environmental (avoided environmental damage costs); economic (mainly employment multiplier effects); deferral or avoidance of transmission and distribution investment costs; and greater access to electricity supply that is highly reliable and resilient. Deficiencies due to the lack of relevant available data and of research on economic modeling of microgrids at the societal level are discussed. The context in which these costs and benefits are measured is the Israeli electricity market, which features a highly centralized, vertically integrated electricity company (Israel Electric Corporation, IEC) with some legacy distribution companies. Moreover, because Israel's transmission and distribution infrastructure investment have declined significantly over the past several years, the Israeli market provides a useful basis for analyses of microgrids as an alternative to such large-scale investments. The analysis reveals that under reasonable assumptions reflecting the current state of microgrid technologies, microgrids may constitute a viable, cost-effective alternative to additional central- station generation requiring new investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure. Specifically, using reasonable assumptions regarding 10-MW incremental investments in a microgrid and in central-station generation with necessary transmission and distribution investments, the analysis indicates that, when considering the reliability, T&D investment deferral, local economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits of each alternative, the net benefits to the Israeli economy from selecting the incremental 10-MW investment in a representative Israeli microgrid may exceed $13,000,000 per year. However, when local economic benefits are not considered, the net benefits decline to approximately $260,000 per year. For perspective, generation capacity additions by the Israel Electric Corporation have averaged 166 MW from 2008 through 2018, reaching 13,775 MW of installed capacity by the end of 2018. Total annual capital investment has averaged approximately $1 billion since 2015, about $400 million of which has been in the generation sector.

	abstract = {Since the advent of the microgrid (MG) concept, almost two decades ago, the energy sector has evolved from a centralized operational approach to a distributed generation paradigm challenged by the increasing number of distributed energy resources (DERs) mainly based on renewable energy. This has encouraged new business models and management strategies looking for a balance between energy generation and consumption, and promoting an efficient utilization of energy resources within MGs and minimizing costs for the market participants. In this context, this paper introduces an efficient management strategy, which is aimed at obtaining a fair division of costs billed by the utilities, without relying on a centralized utility or MG aggregator, through the design of a local event-based energy market within the MG. This event-driven MG energy market operates with blockchain (BC) technology based on smart contracts for electricity transactions to both guarantee veracity and immutability of the data and automate the transactions. The event-based energy market approach focuses on two of the design limitations of BC, namely the amount of information to be stored and the computational burden, which are significantly reduced while maintaining a high level of performance. Furthermore, the prosumer data is obtained by using IEC 61850 standard-based commands within the BC framework. By doing so, the system is compatible with any device irrespective of the manufacturer implementing the IEC 61850 standard. The advantages of this management approach are considerable for: MG participants, in terms of financial benefits; the MG itself, as it can operate more independently from the main grid; and the grid since the MG becomes less unpredictable due to the internal energy exchanges. The proposed strategy is validated on an experimental setup employing low-cost devices.  © 2013 IEEE.},

The use of the blockchain and smart contracts for the Demand Response mechanism allows the creation of an automatic system, where network users can communicate with the DSO to provide their flexibility. The blockchain ensures that the same information is shared among the users of the grid, while preserving user privacy. The DSO notifies the request to increase or reduce the load in a given period of the day using channels, a native abstraction of Hyperledger Fabric. The smart contract computes the support provided by each user to fulfill the requested load adaptation and automatically remunerates users proportionally to their contribution.The first step is to record the energy consumptions of the users in order to evaluate the own daily baseline. Finished this phase, the Demand Response smart contract can start.The blockchain platform used for this application is Hyperledger Fabric since it turned to be flexible for smart contracts implementation and supports multi-tenancy. Results show the possibility to successfully apply the blockchain technology to this particular topic, even considering privacy preserving issues. © 2019 IEEE.},

In spite of the positive features associated to this paradigm, new problems arise such as coordination and uncertainty. In this framework, microgrids (MGs) constitute an effective solution to deal with the coordination and operation of these distributed energy resources. This book chapter proposes a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to address the combined problem of Unit Commitment (UC) and Economic Dispatch (ED). With this end, a detailed model of a MG is introduced together with all the control variables and power restrictions. In order to optimally operate the MG, two operation modes are introduced, which attend to optimize economical factors and the robustness of the solution with respect power demand uncertainty. Therefore, it achieves a robust design that guarantees the power supply for different confidence levels. Finally, the algorithm is applied to an example scenario to illustrate its performance. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Also, advances on the part of control techniques by presenting the results for Extremum Seeking Control (ESC)-based Global Maximum Power Point Tracking (GMPPT) applied to PV microgrids in partially shaded regimes are considered. The influence of the photovoltaic arrays topologies to multimodal characteristic of the PV power is also highlighted. Alternative new materials like ferrite Nano-Core-Shell (NCS) multilayer can be used to construct Thin Film Transistors (TFT) or can be applied for photovoltaic (PV) cells. Hence, the chapter firstly presents how the NCS technology generates nanomaterial layers. The ferrite core is self-assembled by an intermediary first shell to an organic shell represented by para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). The fabricated nano-layers are investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopy technique (SEM) and also by Dynamic Lighting Scattering (DLS). These techniques find a hydrodynamic width for the ferrite NCS of 70.9 nm, besides to a zeta potential for these nanoparticles of 51.6 mV, proving an appropriate stability of the fabricated nanoparticles. Organic semiconductors are recently introduced for the transistor and Organic Solar Cell (OSC) manufacturing. Some Athena/Atlas simulations capture the better feature for the static characteristics for different electronic structures working as transistor or texturized solar cells. Either Nano-Core-Shell, Amorphous-Silicon or Polymers are suitable materials for PV microgrids. The demonstration of current vectors traces and experimental static characteristics of the proposed electronic devices sustain these materials future use to enhance the PV arrays. Furthermore, the energy generated by the PV arrays can be fully harvested using GMPPT algorithm based on advanced ESC scheme. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Power grid resilience, reliability, and sustainability can be improved significantly by decomposing the large grids into networked microgrids (NMGs). However, the optimal energy management problem and preserving the security in NMGs are more complicated and challenging. This paper aims to propose a secured stochastic energy management framework for NMGs based on the modified blockchain approach, utilizing the directed acyclic graph (DAG). Using the decentralized and transparent blockchain technology will help to have higher security and lower risks within the network, thus eliminating the financial fraud and cutting down the total operational cost. In order to address the issues arising in the traditional blockchain models, mainly due to the storage and high complexities of hash address calculations, this paper proposes a new modified blockchain technology based on the DAG method. Also, a novel data restoration technique is developed to provide a way to restore the data with appropriate accuracy. The unscented transform (UT) approach is employed to model the uncertainties of forecast error in hourly load demand, solar power output, and wind turbines power output. Finally, the proposed model is tested on an NMG system with four MGs, including two residential MGs (as the noncrucial loads), a commercial MG (as the intermediate level loads), and a hospital MG (as the crucial loads). © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Power balance in the grid relies on distributed generation (DG) from unpredictable sources forming part of the whole energy traded, and the big power plants guaranteeing stability. Nevertheless, as DG continues to grow, matching supply and demand efficiently becomes increasingly difficult. In the area of microgrids, this becomes a major challenge. The majority of existing research deals solely with preserving the stability of the power grid, while some studies have broadened their focus to include the issue of balancing supply and demand. The aim of this study is to present a solution to the power imbalance problem based on the idea of splitting the energy transaction into small energy fragments (EF), simultaneously generated by the producer and obtained by the consumer with such accuracy that the disturbances are negligible. To this end, a new control scheme is presented, where suppliers and customers take advantage of new technologies (ICT) in order to trade an agreed upon amount of energy with no impact on the power. The effect of the control algorithm on the power grid is evaluated through simulations conducted in a microgrid benchmark network, comparing performance with and without energy transactions. Furthermore, network protocol aspects are analyzed. The simulation results show improvements in grid performance such as reductions in both joule losses and voltage deviation. In conclusion, this improvement results in a reduction of both the utility company control effort, and the reserve power for balancing. Furthermore the avoidance of the need for a central organization, opens up scalability and facilitates a more open and competitive market. © 2019},

	abstract = {The evolution of power systems towards the Smart Grid has introduced a significant number of unsolved issues degrading its accelerated deployment. The centralized control of distributed energy resources (DER) by utilizing virtual power plants is one of the essential Smart Grid ideas lacking plug and play capability. International standard IEC 61850 defines an architecture for describing Smart Grid subsystems. One of the main IEC 61850 contributions is a data model semantics describing different subsystems used for power systems production. The potential to utilize data semantics for describing DERs along with middleware technologies such as eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) can significantly decrease the integration timeframe of advanced power systems architectures such as virtual power plants and microgrids. This paper demonstrates the advantages of using the IEC 61850 standard along with the possibility of utilizing XMPP technology and how this affects new control architectures. Additionally, prototype implementation results are shown depending on the different communication infrastructure settings and application types used for DER control. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The effect of climate change is significant in the arctic regions of the world, with the carbon footprint from diesel-only based electricity generation in remote arctic communities adding to the environmental degradation through greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, oil spills, and black carbon. Moreover, the dependence on diesel and its associated costs are an economic problem for these communities, particularly in the Canadian Arctic, where governments subsidize this fuel. Thus, this article presents specific studies including new variable-speed generator (VSG) technologies that demonstrate the feasibility, impact, and benefits of introducing renewable energy (RE) together with VSGs in remote microgrids in the Canadian Arctic. More specifically, this article describes a two-step procedure to select remote communities for detailed feasibility studies of deployment of RE sources, including a generation expansion planning (GEP) framework and optimization model for RE and new VSG integration applied to the selected communities, to minimize diesel dependence of isolated microgrids and maximize the incorporation of environmentally friendly generation technologies. The proposed approach is applied to communities in Nunavut and the North West Territories in the Canadian Arctic, based on actual data, to study the technoeconomic feasibility of RE integration and develop business cases for diesel generation replacement with RE and VSG generation in these communities. The obtained optimal plans contain diesel-RE hybrid combinations that would yield substantial economic savings and reductions on GHG emissions, which are being used as the base for actual deployments in some of the studied communities. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {It is required to utilize several control loops together to increase reliability and performance of microgrids. The current and voltage magnitudes, frequency and angle information, active and reactive power data provide the involved feedback for normal and island mode operations of microgrid. The hierarchical control structure of microgrid is responsible for microgrid synchronization, optimizing the management costs, control of power share with neighbor grids and utility grid in normal mode while it is responsible for load sharing, distributed generation, and voltage/frequency regulation in both normal and islanding operation modes. The load control of microgrid is performed by using more sophisticated electronic devices as well as regular circuit breakers. This regulation capacity could be improved since the ESS decreases the dependency to primary power sources. Although several improvements have been experienced in microgrid control strategies, the most intensive research areas are listed as decreasing the structural instability, improving the system performance to increase reliability, monitoring the harmonic contents, scaling the control infrastructure, enhancing the operation characteristics in error states, and implementing new control algorithms for normal and islanding operation. The microgrid system has hierarchical control infrastructure in different levels similar to conventional grids. The microgrid requires enhanced control techniques to manage any level of system. Safe operation of microgrid in both operation modes and connection and disconnection between microgrid and utility grid are depended to microgrid control techniques. The controllers should ensure to operate the system regarding to predefined circumstances and efficiency requirements. The hierarchical control methods and applications of microgrid infrastructure are presented in the proposed chapter. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information and microelectronic technology, modern systems usually show characters like dependence, load sharing, redundancy and common cause failures, which brings new challenges to modern systems' reliability assessment (R.P. Hughes et al. 1987, P.E et al. 2000). In order to ensure the working ability and reliability of complex systems, reliability modelling and analysis technologies have become one of the research hotspots to study the life cycle process and failures of complex systems. Throughout the development of reliability technologies, the methods to solve reliability problems can be divided into two types that are based on the probability and the physics of failure (PoF) respectively (Pecht et al. 1995). Focusing on either the logic or the physics of failures, current methods cannot consider both of them effectively. To solve these problems, a hybrid automaton model based on the PoF is proposed in this paper. By transforming components' PoF into the continuous states of cells and converting the fault logics of the system into the conversion rules of the hybrid automaton, a hybrid automaton model can consider both the PoF and the failure logic effectively. The arrangement of this paper is as fellow. First, a definition of a hybrid automaton (HA) is given. Second, the PoF model of components in the system is studied. Then, a formal model construction method of HA is proposed. Afterward, the solving method of HA based on particle filter is given. Finally, the case study is carried out on an example of a micro grid system (Dou et.al 2012). And the new reliability model based on HA is verified to be a suitable tool to address the dynamic reliability problem and to model hybrid systems of high complexity.

	abstract = {The need for effective technologies to deal with environmental issues is one of the basic approaches within the smart grid concept. Electrical vehicles (EV) are promising technology that provides multiple advantages for both utility and consumers. One of the main challenges of EVs is charging management, which effects on efficiency and popularity of EVs operation. For handling this issue, a new concept named battery swapping station (BSS) for more integration of EVs in microgrids is introduced in this chapter. In addition to market participation, BSS as a large energy storage system can provide adequate reserve for microgrid in islanded operation. So, in this chapter, a novel microgrid operation scheduling consisting of BSS is proposed. The problem is formulated as a bi-level problem: the upper-level minimizes microgrid operation cost including generation and purchasing cost, while BSS profit maximization is the target of lower-level. Participation of BSS in the reserve market beside the local generation units, causes the microgrid capability in operating in islanding mode for multiple hours. The proposed model is implemented on the 10-bus microgrid test system where the results show its effectiveness. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

	abstract = {Microgrids are considered as a cost-efficient and reliable energy sources to rural areas and regions with unreliable power supply. The key potential for a low-cost operation and uninterrupted power supply lies in the optimal operation of such microgrids. Optimizing the microgrid operation consists of the optimal management of the power dispatched from the microgrid components for covering the load demand with a minimum cost while satisfying all technical and operational constraints. This leads to a complex optimization problem which is not easy to be solved. This paper presents an active-reactive optimal power dispatch strategy based on the concept of an economic model predictive controller (EMPC). In this operation strategy, the battery lifetime cost, the active-reactive power generation cost and the grid blackout problem are considered. In addition, a cost model for the dispatched reactive power from the PV-system and battery storage system is developed. Furthermore, a new cost model for reactive power generation from the diesel generator is introduced. The computation result shows that the proposed EMPC framework is able to manage the power dispatch in the microgrid in a cost-effective and reliable manner for both grid-connected and islanded mode. Moreover, the proposed operation strategy leads to a significant reduction in the total costs of the dispatched active-reactive power and battery lifetime loss. Furthermore, it is approved that the PV-inverter is able to generate reactive power with very low cost compared to other energy sources in the microgrid. © 2019 International Solar Energy Society},

	abstract = {New Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), such as the Internet of Things (IoT), are enabling the evolution of energy grids towards a sophisticated power network called Smart Grid (SG). In the context of SGs, a microgrid is a self-sustained network that can operate in both grid-connected or stand-along modes. The long-term scheduling of the operation of distributed generators (DG) and renewable energy resources (RES) in microgrids is a problem that requires tough planning and the use of advanced tools to be efficiently addressed. This paper discusses different ICT technologies that can enable microgrid communication for control and management of distributed energy resources (DER). Based on such ICT, we propose a novel agent-based model to address the long-term scheduling of DER in microgrids as a distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP). However, finding the optimal solution for a DCOP is known to be an NP-Hard problem, making difficult to guarantee optimal solutions even for short optimization periods. Hence, for the long-term scheduling of DER, we propose to split the problem into small time windows that can be effectively solved sequentially by off-the-shelf DCOP algorithms. A particular, but general enough case study is used to compare different DCOP algorithms under the proposed model. Results show that DCOP algorithms can find optimal and near-optimal solutions depending on the window size and the scenario considered. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The main aim of these projects is to couple distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) with distributed control of microgrids. Firstly, a DLT based solution for a local market platform has been developed. This enables end customers to participate in new local micro-energy-markets by providing them with a distributed, decentralized, transparent and secure Peer to Peer (P2P) payment system. Secondly, this solution has been integrated with an autonomous (agent-based) grid management. The integrated solution of both marked platform as well as agent based control has been implemented and tested in a real microgrid with different distributed components such as PV System, CHP and different kinds of controllable loads. This microgrid is located in the distributed energy resources laboratory at the University of Reutlingen. Thirdly, the resulting solution is being implemented as an easy to customize market solution by AC2SG Software Oy, a Finland based software company, developing solutions for the Indian market. In a next phase, the solution is going to be tested in real environment in off-grids systems in India. © 2019, European Association for the Development of Renewable Energy, Environment and Power Quality (EA4EPQ).

	abstract = {With the rapid development of information and microelectronic technology, modern systems usually show characters like dependence, load sharing, redundancy and common cause failures, which brings new challenges to modern systems’ reliability assessment (R.P. Hughes et al. 1987, P.E et al. 2000). In order to ensure the working ability and reliability of complex systems, reliability modelling and analysis technologies have become one of the research hotspots to study the life cycle process and failures of complex systems. Throughout the development of reliability technologies, the methods to solve reliability problems can be divided into two types that are based on the probability and the physics of failure (PoF) respectively (Pecht et al. 1995). Focusing on either the logic or the physics of failures, current methods cannot consider both of them effectively. To solve these problems, a hybrid automaton model based on the PoF is proposed in this paper. By transforming components’ PoF into the continuous states of cells and converting the fault logics of the system into the conversion rules of the hybrid automaton, a hybrid automaton model can consider both the PoF and the failure logic effectively. The arrangement of this paper is as fellow. First, a definition of a hybrid automaton (HA) is given. Second, the PoF model of components in the system is studied. Then, a formal model construction method of HA is proposed. Afterward, the solving method of HA based on particle filter is given. Finally, the case study is carried out on an example of a micro grid system (Dou et.al 2012). And the new reliability model based on HA is verified to be a suitable tool to address the dynamic reliability problem and to model hybrid systems of high complexity. © ESREL 2020-PSAM15 Organizers.

With the fast-paced changing technologies in the context of sustainable development, new approaches and concepts are needed to cope with the variability and uncertainty affecting generation, transmission and load demand. The main challenge remains in developing technologies that can efficiently make use of the available renewable resources. Alternatives in the form of microgrids or virtual power plants along with electricity storage are potential candidates for enhancing flexibility. However, intelligence must be added at all levels in the grid and among all the equipment comprising each subsystem, in order to achieve two-way communications and bidirectional flow of power. Then, the concept of smart grid can be realized and, relying upon software systems, it can remotely and automatically dispatch and optimize generation or storage resources in a single, secure and Web-connected way. Deploying smart configurations and metering promises new possibilities for self-managed energy consumption, improved energy efficiency among final consumers and transition to more consumer-centric energy systems via demand response and demand-side management mechanisms. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Moreover, one of the benefits of emerging distribution network as microgrids (MGs) would be self-healing capability. So, in this research a model has been formulated as Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem which determines optimally the power generation of micro turbines (MTs), Energy Storages (ESs) and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units during the normal operation of MGs with consideration of combined gas and electricity network. In case of fault occurrence in MG/MGs and need to compensate the power generation shortage the model determines the power transferring rate of all MGs with normal operation mode, adjacent to the faulty MG/MGs, according to the cost-based optimization. In critical situations load shedding procedure will be applied to the faulty MG/MGs. It would be considered that CHPs supply both heat and electricity loads and the remaining heat demands will be supplied by natural gas network. The proposed model has been applied to the test system with six MGs as three scenarios and also verified by applying to the network with 30 MGs. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.},

Challenges arise in the auction process to ensure individual rationality, incentive compatibility, budget balance, and economic efficiency. This paper offers insights for building the foundation of a P2P energy trading market and presents a comparative analysis of auction mechanisms and bidding strategies for P2P solar electricity exchanges in terms of market demand and supply metrics. Auction mechanisms considered in this paper are Discriminatory and Uniform k-Double Auction (k-DA). Impacts of different bidding strategies, including game theoretic approaches, on the economic efficiencies of the P2P transactive energy market are also studied.

Being an affordable power the installation of PV integrated DC microgrid are growing enormously which will bring new concerns about power system stability. Voltage stability has always been an issue in demand-supply management in DC microgrid. To effectively handle such instability issues new cost effective potential solutions are required. Earlier Electric Spring (ES) has been proposed as the solution to the load management, in the AC microgrids. This paper extends this concept to regulate the bus voltage fluctuation and Fault Ride Through (FRT) condition in DC microgrid by performing dynamically. The objective of the proposed work is to conserve power during generation intermittency by making non-critical loads to absorb less power and adaptively maintaining stable power across critical loads. DC Series Electric Spring (DC-ES) is different from existing technologies which is capable of real time demand side management (DSM). The problems in DC microgrid and their solution with the help of DC-ES have been successfully demonstrated on 48V DC grid for simulation verification using MATLAB environment. The results of DC electric spring show a good agreement with theoretical analysis. © 2020 IEEE.},

The lower level of the model is a distributed power generation dispatching model for the microgrid with its own maximum benefit. The upper level is an economic dispatching model that considers the distribution cost of the interconnected microgrid with the minimum total purchase cost of the system.

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the issue of demand response (DR) in microgrids via vehicle-to-vehicle technology in the smart grid with consideration for location privacy protection supported by Internet of Vehicles. To enable effective DR, the online double auction is a viable approach to support energy trading between electric vehicles (EVs) that have surplus or insufficient energy, while the utility of each participant can be considered. Nonetheless, there are three primary challenges in designing such an online double auction approach. First, as EVs are allowed to enter the market at any time, the auctioneer should make the best decision without further information about bids and asks. Second, as EVs are allowed to enter the market in different places, the auctioneer should perform routing optimization for EV charging after determining the winner. Third, there is a risk of leakage in the location of EVs that needs to be protected. To tackle these issues, we present a new truthful online double auction scheme, which features multiunit energy trading among EVs, routing optimization for EV charging, and location privacy protection. We conduct a theoretical analysis and demonstrate that our online double auction scheme is capable of achieving several important economic properties as well as the privacy guarantee (i.e., k-anonymity). Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve good performance with respect to social welfare, satisfaction ratio, total profit of EV owners, peak load shifting, state of charge, driving distance satisfaction, and computing time, and can further ensure location privacy protection. © 2014 IEEE.},

Sustainability goals and universal commitment have actively pushed renewable generation to push for 50% of overall demand over the next few years. This chapter describes the new energy paradigm with integrated smart systems from field to cloud, with Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, as part of the digital transformation, which will allow energy to be transacted between prosumers, through energy markets. The chapter discusses various DER, from renewable generation to demand response, and gets into the details of underlying digital components that form the foundation of OT+IT (operational and information technologies) systems for transactive energy and smart microgrids. The energy markets, both short and long term, pricing strategies and scheduling are topics that utilities used to care, and now the customers will have to understand and participate. Smart microgrids and transactive energy are described starting from electric and IT system architecture, along with the key functionality of energy management. As this new field evolves, several key observations, considerations, and challenges are presented that will be major topics to watch out for new practitioners. At the end, transactive energy is an irreversible trend and it will be adapted across the world, in various degrees. © 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The paper investigates various system configurations with increasing presence of microgrids, with active devices. System simulations quantify system performance in terms of cost, first using the traditional single-level optimization framework, and second using the proposed bi-level framework. Comparisons between the system with traditional, passive distribution systems and with microgrids are also presented, with results again quantified via the interconnected system operating costs. Results show that at low levels of DER and microgrid penetration, traditional (single-level) system optimization algorithms perform adequately as compared to the proposed bi-level optimization framework. However, as DER and microgrid penetration increase, the traditional single-level framework does not accurately capture the full system benefits of distributed technologies. The results demonstrate that new optimization algorithms, such as the proposed bi-level framework, will be required if the benefits of DER are to be accurately quantified in the evolving power system. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

Their modularizable and scalable nature presents opportunities for the development of a new class of players in the power system, i.e. prosumers. The large-scale integration of RES creates acute challenges to the existing power systems. In this context, a reliable and secured balance between energy generation and consumption is highly required. To overcome these problems at microgrid level, a key role is played by the peer-to-peer energy trading using the blockchain concept. In this paper, we present an efficient approach that can be useful for energy trading using blockchain from both active participants (prosumers and consumers). The proposed approach meets the new Romanian regulation regarding prosumers. The results of the study emphasize that the proposed methodology could lead to an efficient balance between local supply and demand with benefits to the participants. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Ultracapacitors (UCs) are of increasing interest in different application areas, such as microgrids and transportation, which demand high transient power and are growing in capability every day. New power system architectures have been proposed that may be well suited to reliably and efficiently supply power to these previously unseen applications. Among the architectures that hold a great deal of promise are hybrid energy storage modules that integrate energy dense batteries with power dense UCs into a single power supply that augments traditional generation technologies. Within such architecture, the UC is the element that may be utilized to sink and source power quickly, at the leading or falling edge of a transient event. Considerable advances have been made to increase both the power and energy density, respectively, of UCs. Significant reduction of the internal impedance has resulted in an increased power capability that makes UCs well suited for use in these applications. Hybrid UC technologies, such as lithium-ion capacitors, have been developed, which have much higher energy density with nearly the same power density. In an effort to better understand and validate the capabilities of new UC technologies, a series of experiments has been performed on cells from four different manufacturers. Novel experimental testbeds and methods have been used to measure each technology's internal impedance and power density. The experimental testbed utilized, along with the results collected to date, will be presented. © 1973-2012 IEEE.},

Sizing of these generators for an economical microgrid has multi-fold challenges. The primary aspect of sizing formulation is incorporating the effects of short-term decision mechanisms, unit commitment and demand side management which significantly impacts the operational cost of the microgrid. Accounting the degradation of the microgridunits and lifetime based on performance are the other important issues that need to be contemplated in sizing methodology. Also, microgrids are associated with uncertainties in load and power generated by renewable sources. Hence, the microgrid sizing problem is a large-scale stochastic optimization problem. In this manuscript, a unified optimization framework for the sizing of an islanded microgrid with features that can simultaneously handle all the challenging issues mentioned above is proposed. Results obtained using the proposed method are compared with the state-of-the-art sizing algorithm. © 2019},

Blockchain technology also supports incentive mechanisms for users taking part in the service through the generation of utility tokens to recognize the user's contribution. This paper presents the experimental test of a novel methodology for Demand Response programs implementation by using the Blockchain technology. The latter is employed for defining a distributed Demand Response service and a new system for its tracing and certification. For this work, a Smart Contract has been conceived and written to execute Demand Response events, calculate users' baseline, compute the support provided by each user towards the fulfilment of the requested load curve modification and remunerate each user with utility tokens proportionally to their contribution. To test the methodology, a Hyperledger Fabric network and a Smart Contract were deployed on four nodes of the Microgrid Laboratory of the Department of Energy Technology at Aalborg University (DK). Subsequently, a realistic scenario comprising two consumer nodes was developed using power electronic converters for generating the household profiles and Smart Meters for the measurement of the consumption profiles. Theoretical and experimental results show the feasibility of Distributed Ledger Technologies in smart grids management with a minimum investment in new hardware while enabling the active participation of customers in Demand Response more transparently and fairly.  © 2013 IEEE.},

This decentralisation trend requires development of new business models and new ownership structures to enable cost-efficient operation of energy systems. A variety of business models are available to finance these microgrids. A choice of a business model is very important, because it should suit the market environment to face financial risks, fit the regulatory framework, and serve the customers' primary needs in a most efficient and economical way. The latter becomes highly relevant in case of developing countries, where affordability is a major issue when implementing electrification projects.

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have numerous applications and already are an essential asset to microgrid planning and operation. As some BESS technologies still have high capital costs, a control system that searches the optimal solution, avoiding cell degrading conditions while looking for the lowest grid operation costs, is desired. This paper addresses this matter considering a centralized control of distributed energy storage resources in a microgrid.

Countries around the globe are establishing plans to reduce carbon emissions by adopting green sustainable forms of energy. Furthermore, there is also a parallel global race for creating free economic zones within countries to attract business and investment, namely, to diversify their economies and move away from fossil fuels. With its mega project 'Neom', Saudi Arabia is planning to enter the race in a major way. Neom will be a city bordering on Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan with unparalleled capacity for sun and wind. It is envisioned that Neom will heavily rely on renewable energy, thus, it is conceivable that it will be formed of clusters of microgrids with distributed renewable energy sources. However, the stochastic nature of solar and wind energy sources impacts power production causing imbalance between generation and demand. This imbalance, will no doubt grow with time causing frequency to become even less stable and challenging to control. Recent advances in energy storage technology, however, offer a wide range of alternatives to choose from for different applications. This has motivated the development of the energy warehouse (EW) concept, a controlled and managed massive modular energy storage system. Sized and located properly, EW can offer significant technical and economic benefits for Neom including buffering the difference between demand and supply within microgrids, not only to stabilize, but also to suppress frequency abnormalities, reducing losses, mitigating congestion, and increasing efficiency. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Demand Side Management (DSM) is an effective measure in load configuration for microgrid power cost control and power system operation. In most extant studies, DSM in microgrid only consider directly controllable devices for load modification. The load triggered by non-controllable devices with sub-decision-makers are regarded as unchangeable load and generally not considered in DSM. A critical reason for unchangeable load is that the sub-decision makers in these microgrids may not sense and react to external dynamic electricity prices. However, these non-changeable loads in some microgrids contribute significantly to the overall power consumption of the system. Thus, a new demand side management scheme is required for these special microgrids so that the load triggered by these sub-decision makers can also response to external dynamic electricity prices. Based on a case study of a university campus, this study proposes a micro-market module to facilitate the participative behaviours of sub-decision makers in a microgrid with extra financial incentives. A university microgrid DSM optimization model is formulated to optimize the total system cost, the control of the microgrid controllable load, the behaviour of sub-decision makers and the micro-market operations are modelled. A new optimization algorithm, the self-crossover genetic algorithm, is proposed. Empirical data from a university is used to conduct a numerical study to test the proposed module and algorithm. The results show that DSM with the micro-market module can reduce the overall electricity cost of the system, and the proposed self-crossover genetic algorithm out-performs traditional optimization algorithms for the proposed model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

This study proposes a new optimal-technical sizing method based on the Simulink Design Optimization of a stand-alone microgrid with renewable energy sources and energy storage to provide energy to a wireless power transfer system to charge electric vehicles along a motorway and to a hydrogen charging station for fuel cell-powered buses. The results show that the design system can provide energy for the charging of electric vehicles along the motorway and produce the hydrogen consumed by the fuel cell-buses plus a certain tank reserve.

	abstract = {The grid of the future will integrate various distributed energy resources (DERs), microgrids, and other new technologies that will revolutionize our energy delivery systems. These technologies, as well as proposed grid-support functions, require inverter-based systems to achieve incorporation into the overall system(s). However, the presence of inverters and other power electronics changes the behavior of the grid and renders many traditional tools and algorithms less effective. An inverter is typically designed to limit its own current output to avoid overloading. This can result in both voltage collapse at the inverter output and limited energy being delivered during a fault so that protective relays cannot respond properly. To avoid sustained faults and unnecessary loss of service, it is proposed that either supercapacitor or flywheel energy storage be utilized to energize faults upon overload of the inverter to achieve fault current correction. This paper will discuss these challenges for inverter-based system fault detection, explore fault current correction strategies, and provide MATLAB/Simulink simulation results comparing the effectiveness of each strategy. © 2019 IEEE.},

The bidirectional information and energy flows within the envisaged advanced SG together with other aiding devices and objects, promote a new vision to energy supply and demand response. Meanwhile, the gradual shift to the next generation fully fledged SGs will be preceded by individual isolated microgrids voluntarily collaborating in the managing of all the available energy resources within their control to optimally serve both demand and distribution. In so doing, innovative applications will emerge that will bring numerous benefits as well as challenges in the SG. This paper introduces a power management approach that is geared towards optimizing power distribution, trading, as well as storage among cooperative microgrids (MGs). The initial task is to formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and ultimately decompose it into a formulation that jointly considers user utility as well as factors such as MG load variance and associated transmission costs. It is deduced from obtained analytical results that the formulated generic optimization algorithm characterizing both aggregated demand and response from the cooperative microgrids assist greatly in determining the required resources hence enabling operational cost viability of the entire system. © 2020 IEEE.},

The presence of new energy sources, distributed storage, power electronic devices and communication links make a power system’s control and monitoring more complex and adaptive than ever before. Recently, the use of agent-based distributed control has seen to have a significant impact on the grid and microgrid controls. The load-shedding technique is among the features used to balance the power consumption in the power system upon less power production. Towards achieving these, different mechanisms, algorithms, challenges, and approaches have been developed and hence need to be reviewed and integrated from the system solution perspective. This research focuses on the review of the state-of-the-art load-shedding techniques, whereby the focus is on control algorithms, simulation platforms and integrations, and control devices for DC microgrid. The research also investigates open issues and challenges that need further investigations. The analyses reported in the paper upholds the importance of the distributed multi-agent system, MAS, in implementing distinct control operations including load-shedding. The effectiveness of the control operations using MAS rely on low-latency and secure communication links in which IoT has been branded as a promising technology for implementing distributed MAS. © 2019, Engineering and Technology Publishing.

In addition, rapid advancement of technology has enabled the bulk utilization of power generation units and energy storage (ES) systems in distribution networks. The next step in this trend is to decentralize ADSs to microgrids (MGs). This paper aims to present a review on the recent advancements in the development of ADSs and MGs. In this respect, the regulatory requirements and economic concepts, by which the traditional passive DNs are evolved into ADSs, are categorized and illustrated first. Then, the state-of-the-art of ADS formation is detailed based on the novel standpoint of grid operation factors which are involved in deregulated electricity markets at the distribution level. After presenting highlighted projects of MGs across the world, a similar review approach has been adopted to explain the formation of MGs which play a vital role in the decentralization of ADSs.

	abstract = {Owing to the increasing penetration of information and communication technologies and power electronics, low-voltage microgrids with distributed generation may progressively evolve to local area energy networks (E-LANs), that is, energy networks with degrees of flexibility, reliability, robustness, and readiness similar to LANs of digital devices. Thanks to grid meshing and synergistic exploitation of the control potential of distributed energy resources, E-LANs can provide an independent control of the currents flowing in each feeder of the grid. On this basis, new and advanced functionalities become possible, like, simultaneous demand response at multiple utility terminals, active and reactive power steering through grid feeders, and active clearing of lines for maintenance. This paper presents an optimal control for E-LANs, which applies to low-voltage grids of any structure and complexity and assures independent control of the power fed by prosumers. © 2017 IEEE},

	abstract = {The power system remained far beyond in adopting new technologies in key domains such as: automation, information technology and telecommunications. Globally, energy demand is constantly increasing and nowadays the power system has developed according to past and present needs. But, this has to be changed in order to adapt to the future rapid evolutions: today’s digitized society need efficient, scalable and resilient power systems, because, without it, our life style will reduce to an almost medieval existence. The difficulty and complexity of the power system transition from the traditional to the intelligent system consists in the fact that this must be done in order to solve the present problems and to prevent those which the system might face in the future by allowing the new technological innovations. All of this must take place while the system is in operation, without affecting the consumers. Among the risks associated with the traditional power system, based on a small number of large power stations, we mention the need to implement some power plants to take over the over-consumption (peaks), with major disadvantages. Some of the disadvantages can be summarized as follows: they only work temporarily; they do not easily depreciate their costs; low resiliency (e.g. collapse of the system, for natural reasons, or a malfunction in the production or transport chain. Microgrids come with added value through protection, resilience and low cost due to the avoidance of power cuts which, with respect to each sector of activity, generate significant financial losses in case of occurrence. About these challenges and the link between the connectivity of microgrids and the risks they are exposed to, the authors refer in the second paragraph of this chapter. Taking into account the technical requirements of the microgrids, protection solutions for both DC and AC currents will be presented. The level of pollution which our planet is facing imposes certain standards that change the approach of some industries. For example, in the transport sector, the authorities prohibit or impose extra-charges for cars with diesel engines and provide aid for the purchase of electric cars. Such a car raises the electricity needs of a home a few times, the colder winters and hotter summers put pressure on the system again, increasing the likelihood that the power system will crash. Therefore, reference will be made to the appropriate standards to which these protections should be aligned. At the end of the chapter, development trends in this area will be mentioned. The microgrids solve many problems of the classic power system because a power system made up of a microgrids array acts as a whole and, in the event of a problem, it disconnects from the system without propagating up. The probability of the occurrence of a power cut is much diminished because, for example, as in the case of Denmark, the system is decentralized and a problem can be propagated at most on the local level, not nationally, and the energy storage component in the microgrids ensures good functioning during peak periods as well as in the event of a public network failure. Besides certain advantages of implementing microgrids, they come also with new threats from the cyber spectrum, with increased complexity, threats which other sectors have already faced and found solutions. Such examples are given in the fourth paragraph. The chapter ends with conclusions and a large number of references in the field of microgrids protection. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Due to the reduction of fossil fuel production quantities, the communities started to ask: what is the future of electric power systems? Alternative answers and solutions are proposed to be applied instead of conventional fossil fuel power plants. Renewable energy sources are leading these alternatives like wind energy and photovoltaics. From 1990s, consumers start to use dispersed stochastically renewable energy sources in a small scale, in the so called distributed generation. Gradually, the distributed generations started to interconnect together. Developments in communications, computers and information systems, forced these interconnections to take a new shape of electric power systems and called smart grids. The future look to move from smart grids to super grids is really lead to a new concept; microgrids. With deregulation roles, digital power networks, is started to take a place as a new energy-on-demand approach to electric power systems. To serve the approach of digital power networks, the active network management, internet of -thinking- things and the transactive energy concepts are carried out for the adequate operation of these digital networks. This paper will demonstrate the eight terminologies and technologies: distributed generation, smart grid, super grid, microgrid, digital power network, active network management, internet of -thinking- things, and transactive energy concept. Also, it will study the leading reasons to consider the virtual power plants to be the suitable future type of electric power systems. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The high uncertainty associated with renewable power production limits renewable energy penetration in off-grid systems. Advanced control strategies allow for a more effective exploitation of non-dispatchable sources. This paper presents a two-layer predictive management strategy for an off-grid hybrid microgrid featuring controllable and non-controllable generation units and a storage system. The upper layer deals with the unit commitment, while the second layer regulates real-time operation, applying a response filter to smooth out genset load variation. The algorithm is tested on data from a real rural microgrid in Somalia, performing minute-by-minute simulations. Results are compared to the currently deployed management strategy and to a new improved heuristic algorithm. The two new methods attain a fuel consumption reduction with respect to the previous management system of about 15%. Finally, a new configuration for the Somalian microgrid is evaluated, in the two cases where the predictive or heuristic management strategies are adopted. The comparison of the two optimal solutions demonstrates that the adoption of the proposed predictive strategy leads to a 6.5% cut of the overall system cost, ensuring at the same time a 24.1% fuel consumption reduction with respect to the best heuristic solution and attaining a renewable penetration as high as 65.1%. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

With the advance of new lowcarbon technologies (LCTs), different load types, such as heat pumps and electric vehicles (EVs), are emerging. This paper assesses the impact of different EV charging models on the EDR performance. The CCVR technique is considered for both an urban and a rural microgrid, respectively. The Monte Carlo (MC) method is applied to analyze the impact of three different EV charging models (i.e., uncoordinated charging (UC), vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging and mixed charging (MIX)) on the grid EDR performance. In comparison with different EV charging strategies, the impact of V2G strategy on the grid EDR capability is the least, while the MIX strategy can help the grid to increase EV penetration capability more effectively. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.},

	abstract = {A microgrid (MG) is a small-scale power system with a cluster of loads and distributed generators operating together through energy management software and devices that act as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid. MG has become a key research element in smart grid and distribution power systems. MG mainly contains different renewable energy sources (RESs) that use various technological advancements, such as power electronics-based technologies. However, it has an unstable output, thereby causing different types of power quality (PQ) events. As a result, standards and mitigation methods have been developed in recent years. To mitigate PQ issues due to MG integration, various methods and standards have been proposed over the last years. Although these individual methods are well documented, a comparative overview had not been introduced so far. Thus, this study aims to fill the gap by reviewing and comparing the prior-art PQ issues, solutions, and standards in MGs. We compare the main issues related to voltage sag, voltage swell, voltage and current harmonics, system unbalances, and fluctuations to ensure high-quality MG output power. The new technologies associated with MGs generate harmonics emission in the range of 2-150 kHz, thereby causing a new phenomenon, namely, supraharmonics (SH) emission, which is not sufficiently covered in the literature. Therefore, the characteristics, causes, consequences, and measurements of SH are highlighted and analyzed. The mitigation strategies, control, and devices of PQ issues are also discussed. Moreover, a comparison is conducted between the most popular devices used to mitigate the PQ issues in MG in terms of cost, rating, and different aspects of performance. This review study can strengthen the efforts toward the mitigation and standards development of PQ issues in MG applications, especially SH. Finally, some recommendations and suggestions to improve PQ of MG, including SH, are highlighted.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Among those, Distributed Generation (DG) technologies integrated into power systems as alternative energy sources are one of the most important issues and Voltage Source Inverters (VSIs), commonly used as the interface between DGs and the network, and controlled by the conventional droop method, are a good spot to focus on and improve. In this paper, the conventional droop control method is modified to improve parameters in dynamic state responses such as the convergence in circulating current among inverters, active powers and their ratio. The suggested method uses the instantaneous impedance of inverters to better control over droop parameters, while replacing the Low Pass Filter (LPF) in the droop controller with Tavakoli Method's suggested filter, achieving better results than the mentioned methods. © 2018 IEEE.},

This paper discusses the major challenges and potential solid state circuit breaker (SSCB) solutions to address this need. It proposes a new SSCB methodology comprising four key elements: use of wide bandgap semiconductor (WBG) switches, tri-mode operation, combined digital and analog control, and universal hardware/software architectures. We report the design of a 380V/20A intelligent tri-mode SSCB (iBreaker) based on these design principles. We use SiC MOSFET and GaN HEMT in the iBreaker, which features three distinct operation modes: ON, OFF, and PWM Current Limiting (PWM-CL). While the conventional ON/OFF states allow the iBreaker to conduct normal load currents or interrupt fault currents, the PWM-CL state allows the iBreaker to gradually charge the input capacitors of electronic loads at a limited current level during load startup. The iBreaker can switch from the PWM-CL state to the OFF state if a true short circuit fault is detected. In the PWM-CL state, a variable frequency PWM control technique is proposed to optimally operate a buck converter for soft start and short fault detection. The new iBreaker is prototyped and experimentally verified. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The concept of microgrid has emerged as a feasible answer to cope with the increasing number of distributed renewable energy sources which are being introduced into the electrical grid. The microgrid communication network should guarantee a complete and bidirectional connectivity among the microgrid resources, a high reliability and a feasible interoperability. This is in a contrast to the current electrical grid structure which is characterized by the lack of connectivity, being a centralized-unidirectional system. In this paper a review of the microgrids information and communication technologies (ICT) is shown. In addition, a guideline for the transition from the current communication systems to the future generation of microgrid communications is provided. This paper contains a systematic review of the most suitable communication network topologies, technologies and protocols for smart microgrids. It is concluded that a new generation of peer-to-peer communication systems is required towards a dynamic smart microgrid.

As a consequence, the concept of "prosumers" arises, which happens when an entity may become, depending on the operating state, a generator or a source. This scenario brings new concerns since the operating and learning processes must be adapted to this new reality. At the same time, ethical aspects also need to be addressed.

Using high-order controllers, on the other hand, results in rather complex analysis and design process, therefore this paper aims at providing a general and simple theme for the design and parameter selection. The controller also provides adaptive and automated current-based grid synchronization. Moreover, the controller realizes a power-source current-controlled microgrid with minimum control loops, as compared to widely adopted voltage controlled microgrids in the literature, with advantages such as fault-ride-through and inherent droop-less power sharing capabilities. Adaptive current-based synchronization and smooth switching to islanding mode provides high flexibility, reliability and only-plug operation capability. Extensive simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate performance of the proposed control and management strategy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The power industry is continuously changing. Renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation are expected to continue growing, however changes in federal and state policies could also provide needed support for the coal and nuclear power sectors. With the abundance of fracked shale gas, fuel prices have remained relatively low for US gas-fired generators, giving their power a competitive advantage. Lawmakers in Ohio introduced a bill to set up a zero-emission nuclear resource program designed to help the Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear plants remain viable and New Jersey policymakers held a hearing focusing on strategies to prevent premature closure of its nuclear power plants, which could help the Salem and Hope Creek facilities. Meanwhile, advanced technology, distributed generation, battery storage, and microgrids will all play a vital role in the future. According to a forecast by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the global energy storage market is expected to grow to a cumulative 125-GW/305-GWh by 2030 with an investment of about $103 billion would be required over the next 12 yr. Distributed generation comes in various forms, including solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, microturbines, reciprocating engines, fuel cells, and gas turbines. Solar PV is the fastest growing segment.},

	abstract = {The accelerated trend of development in the areas of information and communications technology (ICT), as well as energy systems, has been led to emersion of a new concept called the internet of energy (IoE). This concept is classified as a subsector of the internet of things (IoT), which means the utilization of advanced digital controllers, sensors, actuators, and meters with the ability of information exchange through IT infrastructures. The phrase internet, in this context, does not exclusively refer to the World Wide Web rather than any type of server-based or peer-to-peer network. These communicational tools are able to receive information for local analyze and control, receive analyzed commands, send raw data, or send instructions. The incorporation of IoT in power systems conveys a brilliant future for overcoming power system operation hurdles and environmental challenges, although it incurs a large capital investment portfolio initially. However, it is hoped that the evolution of current technologies and the advent of new technologies with economically affordable prices can help to increase the pervasiveness of these state-of-the-art technologies. IoE covers the entire energy scope such as thermal or electrical energies. However, in this study, the applications of IoE in power systems, as the central core of the energy ecosystem, will be addressed. At first, the basic terminology of this topic such as IoE, IoT, plug play capability, smart energy, future networks, smart grid 2.0, energy 4.0, prosumers, AMI, API, digitalization, and grid edge are described to make the rest of paper more intelligible. Then the role of IoE in supply-side and demand-side of power systems encompassing renewable generation section, large-scale energy storage section, thermal power plant section, system operation and protection as well as execution of demand response programs (DRPs), microgrids, integration of plug-in electric vehicles with V2G capability, and end-user residential consumption management in smart buildings are explained. In this study, it is tried to outline a different classification of IoE in power systems which has not been drawn by previous similar works. © 2019 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose a real-time electricity marketing mechanism for the autonomous micro-grids. Our model is designed to meet the local energy demands while being self-sufficient and achieving high social satisfaction level of its associated producer/consumers (prosumers). To achieve this goal, in our proposed mechanism, the prosumers are clustered and represented by one high-level representative that is called the aggregator. Each aggregator is responsible to participate in the real-time market and make the decision on energy trading to meet the local power consumption demands, maintain the local financial stability, and maximize the satisfaction level of its associated prosumers. Our proposed marketing mechanism leverages a variation of the El-Farol bar problem to model the strategy of the aggregators. Furthermore, to evaluate the satisfaction of the prosumers toward the policy of the local electricity marketing, our proposed mechanism also defines and implements a social sensing model. In our simulations, we evaluate the performance of our electricity marketing mechanism by using a microgrid consisting of eight clusters of prosumers. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of our mechanism in achieving self-sufficiency and relative optimality in terms of load shedding and cumulative financial profit and residential customers' satisfaction. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The existing distribution system operation philosophy faces great challenges as renewable energy penetration and microgrid deployment continue to grow. To address these challenges, new simulation tools need to be developed to investigate the impacts of renewables, distributed generation resources, microgrids, and the interaction between any two of them. To this end, China Southern Power Grid (CSG) developed a Dynamic Simulation Program (DSP) using the state-of-the-art high performance parallel computing technologies. Well-known issues of renewables include high intermittency and low inertia, which require faster control actions to be taken. The existing centralized control requires communication infrastructure from the central controller to all agents, which is prohibitive in the case of high renewable penetration. This paper presents a distributed control framework for a distribution system/microgrid with high renewable penetration. Within this framework, each distributed generator only needs information from its neighbor(s) to achieve optimal operation. This paper presents the modeling of various distributed generators and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm using this recently developed DSP, through which the advanced features of the software are also showcased. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The chapter will explore the growth and opportunities of small-scale local power generation and the implications for internet access for rural communities. Solar power has grown exponentially in the last decade across the world and has provided opportunities for the development of local energy communities and on microgrids across the world and in Europe. The huge cost reductions experienced in solar and its relative mobile and flexible nature have made it a technology perfect for rural areas to develop their own sustainable source of electricity supply. The increasing rise of digital tools has coupled nicely with the advent of mass use of solar in rural areas and thus the connection between smart solar and smart villages has become increasingly a norm. Rural communities in Europe have embraced solar technology, with many farmers using solar as a means to reduce their electricity costs and also generate new streams of income to improve their overall livelihoods. Some case studies from India, Germany, and Africa will be examined. Other experiences will also be considered, especially where double land use between solar technology and livestock has empowered rural communities. Outside of Europe, Africa and Asia have also seen solar as a means to electrify remote rural villages. This has lead to the development of microgrids and new technologies that are less deployed in Europe, which are being rolled out for rural communities in the rest of the world. This has been particularly successful in creating smart rural communities as often digital communications have already reached these communities and thus power and telecoms are combining to provide clean and controlled power for millions in Africa. This chapter will also assess the growth of smart energy communities in non-traditional energy markets and determine what lessons we can learn from their experiences. This chapter will examine other sources of renewable energy and the role that biogas, biomass, and others are playing in the creation of smart villages in Europe and beyond. Biomass has been the traditional tool for many rural communities to generate power and heat and thus an examination of how it now plays a role in smart villages is vital to understanding the energy transition we are experiencing in rural communities. © 2019 Editorial matter and selection.},

	abstract = {Deployment of distributed generation technologies, especially solar photovoltaic, have turned regular consumers into active contributors to the local supply of electricity. This development along with the digitalisation of power distribution grids (smart grids) is setting the scene to a new paradigm: peer-to-peer electricity trading. The design of the features and rules on how to sell or buy electricity locally, however, is in its early stages for microgrids or small communities. Market design research focuses predominantly on established electricity markets and not so much on incentivising local trading. This is partially because concepts of local markets carry distinct features: the diversity and characteristics of distributed generation, the specific rules for local electricity prices, and the role of digitalisation tools to facilitate peer-to-peer trade (e.g. Blockchain). As different local or peer-to-peer energy trading schemes have emerged recently, this paper proposes two market designs centred on the role of electricity storage. That is, we focus on the following questions: What is the value of prosumer batteries in P2P trade?; What market features do battery system configurations need?; and What electricity market design will open the economical potential of end-user batteries? To address these questions, we implement an optimisation model to represent the peer-to-peer interactions in the presence of storage for a small community in London, United Kingdom. We investigate the contribution of batteries located at the customer level versus a central battery shared by the community. Results show that the combined features of trade and flexibility from storage produce savings of up to 31% for the end-users. More than half of the savings comes from cooperation and trading in the community, while the rest is due to battery's flexibility in balancing supply-demand operations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

This system includes interconnected microgrids that can draw energy from renewable and non-renewable sources. Considering the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, it might be difficult for the microgrids to constantly accommodate all the consumers connected to them. Therefore, complexity of the future smart energy systems arises from the multiplicity of interacting players operating as independent decision makers with autonomous behaviors, attitudes and goals. In this context, this paper is an overview concerning the potential of applying Game Theory in the development of a real-Time pricing game and a mechanism of energy management in a free electricity market, where several independent electricity suppliers will coexist. This work proposes a model of power exchange based on a Game Theory and a new Hybrid Genetic Algorithm to compute the Nash Equilibrium. We will prove that our algorithm optimizes real-Time cost of power, and energy losses. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Power systems around the world continue to change with the increasing adoption of distributed generation in the form of renewable energy technologies. The increasing penetrations of intermittent renewable energy technologies necessitates improvements in power sharing control, with microgrids being a popular arrangement for large numbers of distributed energy sources. In recent years a new method for autonomously sharing power has been researched known as virtual oscillator control (VOC). Autonomous/Wireless power-sharing methods are however susceptible to steady state power sharing error due to heterogeneous network impedances. This paper presents a novel low-bandwidth secondary controller that adjusts the set-points of the virtual oscillator controller to mitigate power-sharing error caused by heterogeneous network impedances. The virtual oscillator controller is shown to exceed the performance of the droop controller during transient events, however a small inherent power coupling is demonstrated in the virtual oscillator system with heterogeneous network resistances. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Governmental incentives to use clean energy, concerns about high and rising prices of fossil fuels, and environmental issues are the most important motivations for adding distributed energy resources to conventional power systems. In these circumstances, new technologies such as combined cooling, heating, and power systems, energy storage systems including battery and thermal storages, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles not only can improve system efficiency but also can reduce operation and investment cost as well as emissions. In this paper, a residential microgrid consisting of combined cooling, heating and power, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, photovoltaic unit, and battery energy storage systems is modeled to obtain the optimal scheduling state of these units by taking into account the uncertainty of distributed energy resources. To achieve this goal, a scenario-based method is used to model uncertainties of electrical market price, electrical and thermal demand, and solar irradiance using Normal, Weibull, and Beta probability distribution functions, respectively. The scenario tree is used to generate scenarios and representative scenarios are selected with scenario reduction techniques. The proposed problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming to minimize objectives of operation cost and total emissions. This multi-objective problem is solved by the Augmented ɛ-constraint method and the best solution on the Pareto front set is determined by a fuzzy approach. In order to maintain system reliability during on-peak periods, the time-of-use demand response program is considered to promote a change in energy consumption patterns. Finally, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles are considered as electrical energy storage instead of batteries in optimal energy and emissions management. Proposed energy management is applied on a residential microgrid and the effectiveness of the model is verified. It is found that uncertainties increase the cost by 12.2%; however, energy storage systems reduce cost and emissions by 4.7% and 23%, respectively. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, the need for electricity has increased in households as new and different appliances are progressively introduced. This increased demand for electricity raises a concern to many developed and developing countries since it is a human's responsibility to assure a sustainable future. Energy demand management can be an effective approach to reduce the energy consumption; this approach requires final consumers to be empowered with more information for improving their decision-making and actions on the energy usage through increased awareness. Therefore, metering and behind the meter monitoring systems have a crucial role in the exploitation of this potential in the customer side. A significant disadvantage of traditional meters is the fact that they do not provide detailed information to the customers, which is achieved with the help of smart meters. A smart meter allows the customers to have access to the information about electricity consumption of the appliances in their houses. The acceptance of smart meters by customers is the fundamental step to achieve the potential carbon emission reductions that are provided by the use of advanced metering infrastructures. The smart meter is an advanced energy meter that measures consumption of electrical energy such as a traditional meter but also provides additional information in real time, making it the key element of the new energy demand management system. Integration of smart meters into electricity grids implies the implementation of several technologies, depending on the features that each situation request. The design of a smart meter has been in constant development since it is increasingly necessary to satisfy both the requirements of the utility company and those of the customer. Therefore, smart metering provides benefits to the energy utilities optimizing their business, and beyond that it can provide advantages to the final customers. All over the world many smart metering projects have been developed. However, it is still not entirely clear which are the associated costs, the characteristics, and the mechanisms internal to projects that bring advantages and benefits for the different concerned parties. The smart metering methods and the communication technologies used in smart grid are being substantially studied due to widespread applications of smart grid. The monitoring and control processes are largely used in industrial systems. Nevertheless, the energy management requirements at service supplier and customer promoted the evolution of smart grid and consequently the development of microgrids. This chapter discusses various characteristics and technologies that can be integrated with a smart meter for smart grids and microgrids uses. In fact, placement of smart meters needs proper selection and implementation of a communication network fulfilling the security standards of smart grid/microgrid communication. This chapter outlines various issues and challenges involved in design, deployment, utilization, and maintenance of the smart metering infrastructure. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

	abstract = {With the increasing proportion of renewable energy in microgrids (MGs), its stochastic fluctuation of output power has posed challenges to system safety and operation, especially frequency stability. Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) technology, as one effectivemethod, was used to smoothen frequency fluctuation and improve the system's dynamic performance,which can simulate the inertia and damping of the traditional synchronous generator. This study outlines the integration of VSG-controlled energy storage systems (ESSs) and traditional synchronous generators so they jointly participate in secondary frequency regulation in an independent MG. Firstly, a new uncertain state-space model for secondary frequency control is established, considering the measurement noises and modelling error. Then, an improved linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controller is designed based on stochastic optimal control theory, in which the dynamic performance index weighting matrices are optimized by combining loop transfer recovery (LTR) technology and the distribution estimation algorithm. On the issue of secondary frequency devices' output power allocation, the dynamic participation factors based on the ESS's current state of charge (SOC) are proposed to prevent the batteries' overcharging and overdischarging problems. The energy storage devices' service life can be prolonged and OPEX (operational expenditure) decreased. Multiple experimental scenarios with real parameters ofMGs are employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that, compared with the lead-compensated-proportional-integral-derivative (LC-PID) control and robust β-control algorithms, the proposed stochastic optimal controlmethod has a faster dynamic response and ismore robust, and the fluctuations from renewable energy and power loads can be smoothened more effectively. © 2018 Energies.

	abstract = {Over the past eight years, off-grid systems, in the form of stand-alone solar home systems (SHSs), have proved the most popular and immediate solution for increasing energy access in rural areas across the Global South. Although deployed in significant numbers, issues remain with the cost, reliability, utilization, sustainability and scalability of these off-grid systems to provide higher-tiered energy access. Interconnection of existing stand-alone solar home systems (SHSs) can form a microgrid of interconnected prosumers (i.e., households owning SHS capable of producing and consuming power) and consumers (i.e., households without an SHS, and only capable of consuming power). This paper focuses on the role of a smart energy management (SEM) platform in the interconnection of off-grid systems and making bottom-up electrification scalable, and how it can improve the overall sustainability, efficiency and flexibility of off-grid technology. An interconnected SHS microgrid has the potential to unlock latent generation and storage capacity, and so effectively promote connected customers to higher tiers of energy access. This approach can therefore extend the range of products currently used by people located in the remote areas of developing countries to include higher-power devices such as refrigerators, TVs and potentially, electric cookers. This paper shows the results of field studies in the Northern Province of Rwanda within off-grid villages where people mainly rely on SHSs as a source of electricity. These field studies have informed further simulation-based studies that define the principal requirements for the operation of a smart energy management platform for the interconnection of SHSs to form a community microgrid. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Solid State Transformers (SST) may become, in the near future, key technological enablers for decentralized energy supply systems. They have the potential to unleash new technologies and operation strategies of microgrids and prosumers to move faster towards a low carbon-based economy. This work proposes a paradigm change in the hierarchically and distributed operated power systems where SSTs are used to asynchronously connect the many small low voltage (LV) distribution networks, such as clusters of prosumers or LV microgrids, to the bulk power system. The need for asynchronously coupled microgrids requires a design that allows the LV system to operate independently from the bulk grid and to rely on its own control systems. The purpose of this new approach is to achieve immune and resilient by design configurations that allow maximizing the integration of Local Renewable Energy Resources (L-RES). The paper analyses from the stability point of view, through simplified numerical simulations, the way in which SST-interconnected microgrids can become immune to disturbances that occur in the bulk power system and how sudden changes in the microgrid can damp out at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC), thus achieving better reliability and predictability in both systems and enabling strong and healthy distributed energy storage systems (DESSs). Moreover, it is shown that in a fully inverter-based microgrid there is no need for mechanical or synthetic inertia to stabilize the microgrid during power unbalances. This happens because the electrostatic energy stored in the capacitors connected behind the SST inverter can be used for a brief time interval, until automation is activated to address the power unbalance for a longer term. © 2018 by the authors.},

The approach allows representing the sources of uncertainty in the data or approximations made during the computation and considering many possible scenarios in case of outages. In order to demonstrate the performance and the effectiveness of the proposed method, several simulations have been carried out on a 69-bus radial distribution system, and results have been compared with those obtained by using a stochastic optimization approach.

Since the stability of local network is a prerequisite for the normal operation of the entire EI, the direct current (DC) bus voltage stabilization for each individual DC microgrid (MG) is a core issue. In this paper, the dynamics of the EI system is modeled with a continuous stochastic system, which simultaneously considers related time-varying delays and norm-bounded modeling uncertainty. Meanwhile, the voltage stabilization issue is converted into a robust H∞ control problem solved via a linear matrix inequality approach. To avoid the situation of over-control, constraints are set in controllers. The problem of finding a balance between voltage regulation performance and constraints for the controllers was also extensively investigated. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed methods is evaluated with numerical simulations. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In order to achieve the objective of universal electricity access by 2030, new microgrids need to serve 630 million people globally. To achieve this goal, new finance models need to be developed and implemented. Load profiles of rural consumers are crucial for off-grid systems capacity planning and control. The combination of detailed load profiles with benefit assessment of rural electricity can provide important insights into the social dynamics of communities ready to adopt microgrid technologies and an important incentive to guide demand side management. We propose a Load Profile - Benefit Assessment (LPBA) methodology that integrates microgrid data, analyzed through mean shift clustering clustering technique, with mixed method instrumentation to adequately assess the impact electricity use has on consumers. Enabled by wellbeing assessment methodology, LPBA could change the perceived investment risk by taking a deeper look at the reasons why a rural electrification business succeeds or fails. Preliminary data from a case study of a rural secondary school in Tanzania is used here to illustrate the methodology. While microgrids connected to a reliable grid seek to reduce cost or maximize the hours of power output when the price per kWh is higher, the LPBA provides a general guideline for microgrid users to manage power consumption with the goal of maximizing wellbeing benefits. Initial results indicate that in order to scale up methodologies such as LPBA, innovation is needed in affordable smart meters, near-real time signal processing tools, and transactive energy appropriate technology. © 2018 IEEE.},

Recent cost reductions in the telecommunication sector and some generation technologies, especially renewable-based, with improved economic feasibility have paved the way for new electric infrastructures. This is especially true for emerging economies, as locally dispatched hybridmicrogrids introduce flexibility and show the promise of technical and economic advantages. The design and integration of microgrids require detailed assessments to ensure the effective deployment of capital to minimize the risk of stranded assets and capital waste. Microgrids can be considered an affordable option for a rapid response to the electrification challenge, recognizing that, in the longer horizon, a sharing of resources with the bulk electrical power system will remain, technically and economically, advantageous. This article presents a comprehensive review of the approaches commonly adopted for microgrid electrification. A "real-life" study case is reported to highlight the operational challenges of a stand-alone microgrid versus a grid-connected system. The need for an improved regulatory framework is presented as the cornerstone problem to be solved to allow an effective integration of microgrids in the national grid. © 2019 IEEE.},

However, factors affecting households’ technology adoption decisions remain poorly understood. Using data on solar microgrid adoption from rural India, we investigate the determinants of household technology adoption. We offer all households identical solar products to avoid bias from product differentiation. Households pay a monthly fee for technology use, allowing us to abstract away from credit constraints as a barrier to adoption. The results show that household expenditures and savings as well as the household head's entrepreneurial attitude are strong predictors of adoption. In contrast, past fuel expenditures, risk acceptance, and community trust are not associated with technology adoption decisions. These findings suggest new directions for research on the microeconomics of household technology adoption, which is critical for sustainable development among the poor in developing countries. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

We discuss aspects of the module design that complied with the limits established in the IEEE Std. 519-2014, 'IEEE Recommended Practice for Harmonic Control in Electric Power Systems', and IEEE Std. 1547a-2014, 'IEEE Standard for Interconnecting Distributed Resources with Electric Power Systems'. Finally, we discuss the implications of the disturbances as those observed during experimentation in the overall power quality of the grid-connected system. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microgrids are an essential element of smart grids and are identified as a key component for improving power reliability and quality, increasing system energy efficiency, and providing the possibility of grid-independence to individual end-user sites. Microgrids support a flexible and efficient electric grid by enabling the integration of growing deployments of distributed energy resources such as solar and wind power. According to a recent Navigant report, spending on microgrid enabling technologies will reach 112 billion dollars by 2026. While the development of microgrids and distributed energy technologies are underway, a recent Department of Energy jobs report indicates that the U.S. does not have enough skilled workers to fill 1.5 million new energy jobs by 2030. Furthermore, even the most experienced workers often lack the updated skills and training needed to successfully support the advanced systems, tools and devices that make up microgrids. Hence it is important to develop new courses that can equip our students with the necessary technical skills to enter the microgrids job market. This paper presents the development of a new course on microgrids and distributed energy resources. This course is a follow up to a previously developed course on Smart Grids. The paper will discuss the course content, the pedagogical approach used to deliver the course, and some of the students' projects and presentations. Copyright © 2018 ASME.},

	abstract = {Physical activity is healthy and can – and needs to be – part of transport. On bikes and electric bikes (E-bikes), it provides kinetic energy for motion. But physical activity can also generate electricity for uses combining transport with communication and other activities. Examples of these mergers include pedal power summoning emergency air transport via the Royal Flying Doctor Service, pedal powered phone chargers at train stations and airports, and on-bike generation for lights and smartphones. However, new mergers of power generation and transport are in development, and this article discusses Shebs, or Series Hybrid Electric Bikes, alternatives to E-bikes using electricity generated on cycles for motive power. Electricity generation on cycles allows effort to be used for a range of tasks. In transport this can be where direct human power is insufficient or can’t be applied easily to drive a vehicle. Examples are where long or exposed transmissions are a problem or the vehicle is self-driving. The technology is being applied to vehicles such as velomobiles which can have stability, aerodynamic, and weather protection advantages over more conventional cycles. As electric machines involving energy, E-bikes can be part of low emission networks such as DC (direct current) microgrids. These grids are fulfilling household electricity needs for lighting, charging computers and driving fans. However most E-bikes can only take power from microgrids. Series Hybrid Electric Bikes can supply them as well. This article discusses existing machines and their potential for generating energy for microgrids, and proposes a new machine designed with this purpose in mind. This paper highlights machines generating electricity through human power and contributing to transport, communication and sustainability. The technologies involved include low current DC power and new human powered vehicle designs, both becoming more important as decarbonisation of transport and economies continue. © 2018 ATRF, Commonwealth of Australia.

	abstract = {The concept of active distribution network has emerged by the application of new generation and storage technologies, demand flexibility, and communication infrastructure. The main goal is to create infrastructure and algorithms to facilitate an increased penetration of distributed energy resources, application of demand response and storage technologies, and encourage local generation and consumption within the distribution network. However, managing thousands of prosumers with different requirements and objectives is a challenging task. To do so, market mechanisms are found to be necessary to fully exploit the potential of customers, known as Prosumers in this new era. This paper offers an advanced retail electricity market based on game theory for the optimal operation of home microgrids (H-MGs) and their interoperability within active distribution networks. The proposed market accommodates any number of retailers and prosumers incorporating different generation sources, storage devices, retailers, and demand response resources. It is formulated considering three different types of players, namely generator, consumer, and retailer. The optimal solution is achieved using the Nikaido-Isoda Relaxation Algorithm (NIRA) in a non-cooperative gaming structure. The uncertainty of the generation and demand are also taken into account using appropriate statistical models. A comprehensive simulation study is carried out to reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method in lowering the market clearing price (MCP) for about 4%, increasing H-MG responsive load consumption by a factor of two, and promoting local generation by a factor of three. The numerical results also show the capability of the proposed algorithm to encourage market participation and improve profit for all participants. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Looking to the future, there are several challenges that the electricity networks will face: prosperity, sustainable growth, global, and security. The electricity industry situation is complex because resources across the world are becoming scarce and the need for sustainable growth is increasingly important. The evolution of a decarbonized economy involves three main aspects: developing energy efficiency measures, developing renewable energy capabilities, and dealing with adaptation needs arising due to climate change. However, the massive integration of generation technologies based on power electronic converters (PECs) are producing adverse effects for transmission system operators (TSOs) and distribution network operators (DNOs). The TSOs and DNOs are witnessing this loss of control of their systems and are exploring the possibility of requiring these new generators to adopt a set of functionalities to help mitigate the side effects caused by the converter/renewable generation. The concept of power converter-based microgrids (MGs) provides vast opportunities for many service providers who can help operate the transmission system. The classical concept of an MG defines it as a set of interconnected distributed energy resources (DERs) capable of providing sufficient and continuous energy to a significant portion of internal load demand. The MG concept has been extraordinary explored in the literature, especially with regard to the connection to the traditional alternating current (AC) system. However, the most recent development of grid-friendly or smart-converters allows the PECs to perform additional tasks that could help the TSO with operational problems, such as voltage control, low short-circuit currents, etc. This chapter is dedicated to introducing the concept of grid-friendly or smart-converters and how they can be used to create fully controllable MGs able to provide auxiliaries services to the transmission system: the so-called “transmission system-friendly microgrid.” This is an AC MG fully dominated by power-converter technologies, where the local and wide control is used in the mode of a power converter, which enables novel operational functions, for example, reactive power provision to enable voltage control. This chapter presents the concept of grid-friendly or smart-converters and their main capabilities. Their functions are enhanced by a wide-area control and the concept is a transmission system-friendly MG. The chapter includes numerical results of the proposed control algorithm and its implementation using Python and simulations using DIgSILENT PowerFactory to demonstrate the suitability of the proposed transmission system-friendly MG. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {In the midst of intensifying global competition over green energy systems, Korean and Taiwanese companies are rapidly rising as serious exporters of smart microgrids. What explains the emergence of an East Asian presence in the global green energy sector? My core argument is that policymakers in Korea and Taiwan view smart microgrids strategically as a new developmental infrastructure, which will help position domestic firms onto a new competitive footing. I show that in Korea, this is taking place through the state’s leveraging of the nation’s innovation champions–globally leading chaebol or conglomerates and their networks of small and medium enterprise (SME) suppliers in the domestic market. In Taiwan, the state has leveraged government research institutes and their rich networks with internationally competitive SMEs and with large domestic firms. These efforts reflect the creation of a new form of public and private cooperation, which I refer to as ‘hybridized industrial ecosystems’. These institutional mutations in the green energy sector suggest that the state’s transformative capacity has been expanding, not shrinking as many recent writers on the developmental state conclude. Overall, the findings from this fresh new sector represents the unfolding of a new chapter of developmental thinking in East Asia. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Finally, it teases and looks ahead to collaborative autonomic control mode, some relative key problems and possible solutions. Collaborative autonomic control mode plays a role in undertaking large power grid due to reduced difficulty in distribution grid control and helps to accommodate distributed renewable energy effectively due to improved management flexibility.

But global environmental concerns are pushing for the transformation of these systems into renewable-based microgrids. This transition to more complex systems with a mix of dispatchable and nondispatchable resources requires new planning tools that ensure the security of supply. This paper presents a novel mixed-integer linear optimization model that determines optimal technology mix, size, placement, and associated dispatch for a multi-energy microgrid. The model satisfies microgrid's electrical and heat transfer network limitations by integrating linear power flow and heat transfer equations. It captures the efficiency gains from waste heat recovery through combined heat and power technologies, by modeling the interplay between electrical and heat sources. To ensure a secure design against generator outages, the optimization maintains sufficient reserve capacity in the system, which is dynamically allocated based on system operating conditions. Several case studies on an isolated microgrid model, developed based on a real microgrid in Alaska, illustrate how the proposed model works. The results show the effectiveness of the model and are used to discuss various aspects of the optimization solution. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The dissemination of decentralized renewable energy generation, storage and smart metering devices has led to the need for new business models and coordination mechanisms in the energy sector. At the same time, the emerging sharing economy focuses on using digital platforms to coordinate value creation on a decentralized level. While sharing concepts have already been applied to specific energy technologies and microgrids, a more general understanding of what the sharing economy means in the context of the energy sector is still missing. This paper aims to bring these two topics together and to analyze their interfaces and overlaps. For this purpose, this paper draws from existent scientific publications, reports, blog posts, and websites as well as company workshops to discuss which activities and characteristics of the sharing economy might be applicable to the energy sector. Results show that there are significant overlaps in characteristics of the sharing economy and of the transitioning energy system. Furthermore, a broad range of business models within the energy system were found to be based on sharing resources. The findings of this study open up a range of new research and business opportunities at the interface of the sharing economy and the transitioning energy system. © 2019 by the author.},

	abstract = {Smart integration of technology can help create sustainable urban food ecosystems (UFEs) for the rapidly expanding urban population in the developing world. Technology, especially recent advances in digital-enabled devices based on internet connectivity, are essential for building UFEs at a time when food production is increasingly limited on a global scale by the availability of land, water, and energy. By 2050, two-thirds of the world will be urban—and most of the net world population growth will occur in urban regions in the developing world. A food crisis is looming, with the developing world ill-prepared to sustainably feed itself. We identify 12 innovative technology platforms to advance the UFEs of the developing world: (1) connectivity—information delivery and digital technology platforms; (2) uberized services; (3) precision agriculture (GPS, IoT—Internet of things, AI—artificial intelligence, sensing technology); (4) CEA—controlled environment agriculture, including vertical farms; (5) blockchain for greater transparency, food safety, and identification; (6) solar and wind power connected to microgrids; (7) high-quality, enhanced seeds for greater yield, nutrition, climate, and pest resistance; (8) advanced genetics, including gene editing, synthetic biology, and cloud biology; (9) biotechnology, including microbiome editing, soil biologicals, cultured meat, alternative proteins to meat and dairy; (10) nanotechnology and advanced materials; (11) 3-D printing/additive manufacturing; and (12) integration of new tech to scale-up underutilized, existing technologies. The new tech-enabled UFEs, linked to value-chains, will create entrepreneurial opportunities—and more efficiently use resources and people to connect the nexus of food, water, energy, and nutrition. © Copyright © 2018 Davies and Garrett.},

	abstract = {Due to the unique structure and special characteristics of electric distribution networks, along with the increase in the number and severity of the natural disasters in recent years, presenting a proper framework and procedure for evaluating the resiliency of these systems is more essential. In addition, it is obligatory to model the different capabilities and features of the smart grids components in order to provide a better knowledge about their expected performance in such circumstances. In response to these challenges, this paper addresses the concept of resiliency and its dimensions in distribution networks. A new model based on mixed-integer linear programming is proposed to properly model and evaluate the resiliency of smart distribution systems. In the proposed model, optimal formation of dynamic microgrids (MGs), their service areas, and the optimal management of different technologies such as energy storage (ES) units, demand side management programs and distributed generations (DGs) units are investigated. In addition, employing a two-stage framework based on stochastic programming, the impact of increasing penetration level of the renewable energy resources and their related uncertainties on system resiliency is examined. The efficiency and applicability of the proposed integrated model is verified by performing multiple simulations on the modified 118-bus test system and a real distribution network. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the state of the art control strategies specifically designed to coordinate distributed energy storage (ES) systems in microgrids. Power networks are undergoing a transition from the traditional model of centralised generation towards a smart decentralised network of renewable sources and ES systems, organised into autonomous microgrids. ES systems can provide a range of services, particularly when distributed throughout the power network. The introduction of distributed ES represents a fundamental change for power networks, increasing the network control problem dimensionality and adding long time-scale dynamics associated with the storage systems' state of charge levels. Managing microgrids with many small distributed ES systems requires new scalable control strategies that are robust to power network and communication network disturbances. This paper reviews the range of services distributed ES systems can provide, and the control challenges they introduce. The focus of this paper is a presentation of the latest decentralised, centralised and distributed multi-agent control strategies designed to coordinate distributed microgrid ES systems. Finally, multi-agent control with agents satisfying Wooldridge's definition of intelligence is proposed as a promising direction for future research. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The development of the smart grid concept implies major changes in the operation and planning of distribution systems, particularly in Low Voltage (LV) networks. The majority of small-scale Distributed Energy Resources (DER)-microgeneration units, energy storage devices, and flexible loads-are connected to LV networks, requiring local control solutions to mitigate technical problems resulting from its integration in the system. Simultaneously, LV connected DER can be aggregated in small cells in order to globally provide new functionalities to system operators. Within this view, the Microgrid (MG) concept has been pointed out as a solution to extend and decentralize the distribution network monitoring and control capability. An MG is a highly flexible, active, and controllable LV cell, incorporating microgeneration units based on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) or low carbon technologies for small-scale combined heat and power applications, energy storage devices, and loads. The coordination of MG local resources, achieved through an appropriated network of controllers and communication system, endows the LV system with sufficient autonomy to operate interconnected to the upstream network or autonomously-emergency operation. In this case, the potentialities of DER can be truly realized if the islanded operation is allowed and bottom-up black start functionalities are implemented. To achieve this operational capability, this chapter presents the control procedures to be used in such a system to deal with the islanded operation and to exploit the local generation resources as a way to help in power system restoration in case of an emergency situation. A sequence of actions for a black start procedure is identified, and it is expected to be an advantage for power system operation regarding reliability as a result from the presence of a huge amount of dispersed generation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

	abstract = {Variable switching frequency in the finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) method causes a negative impact on the converter efficiency and the design of the output filters. Several studies have addressed the problem, but they are either complicated or require heavy computation. This study proposes a new model predictive control (MPC) method with constant switching frequency, which is simple to implement and needs only a small computation time. The proposed MPC method is based on the gradient descent (GD) method to find the optimal voltage vector. Since the cost function of the MPC method is represented in the strongly convex function, the optimal voltage vector could be found quickly by using the GD method, which reduces the computation time of the MPC method. The design of the proposed MPC method based on GD (GD-MPC) is shown in this study. The feasibility of the proposed GD-MPC is evaluated in the real-time simulation using OPAL-RT technologies. The performance of the proposed method in the case of single inverter operation or parallel inverter operation is shown. A comparison study on the proposed GD-MPC and the MPC with the concept of the virtual state vector (VSV-MPC) is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed predictive control. Real-time simulation results show that the proposed GD-MPC method performs better with a low total harmonic distortion (THD) value of output current and short computation time, compared to the VSV-MPC method. © 2019 by the authors.

In geothermal this means the highest temperature, maximum flow hydrothermal resources from the largest thermal reservoirs. Emphasis has also been on large, utility-scale baseload power generation. The technology was supplied by a limited number of firms who focused on up-scaling and improving the reliability of the wet steam turbine and the pentane organic Rankine cycle for bottoming or binary configurations. The future trends for geothermal development are in the direction of smaller, lower temperature plants with designs adapted to the resource conditions and opportunities for co-generation. This trend is true in both countries with established national grids and in developing countries where baseload is needed for new industries and microgrids. New technology suppliers are making the most of R&D improvements in design and adaptation of prior knowledge-based engineering to be able to deliver plants in a range of sizes and for lower temperatures. The additional factor of technology development and cost reductions from the fracking oil and gas boom and bust means that lower cost drilling and exploration are available to support smaller-scale geothermal in developing countries. © 2018 International Journal of Caring Sciences.

	abstract = {As a result of the rapid development of DC charging and the extensive use of electronic devices, the number of DC loads has increased dramatically. Loads have the characteristics of AC and DC coexist. At the same time, there are many distributed power sources in microgrids, such as PV, wind power generation, and so on. With natural DC properties, some new energy power generation forms such as PV can not only be able to achieve direct current conversion and transmission at the power generation side, but also be directly applied to DC loads and inverted at the load side for AC loads. In this way, energy losses during converting will be reduced and the structure of the power system will be simplified. In addition, it can enhance the absorption of new energy and realize the demand of diversified power supply. VSC-HVDC is the best way to solve this problem. Focusing on the flexible substation of the Alibaba Data @Hub in Zhang Bei, China, this paper describes the construction and working principle of a VSC-HVDC power transmission and distribution system based on photovoltaic power generation. Accordingly, the necessity of a multi-terminal flexible DC (MTDC)transmission technology is proposed. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The requirement of system decarbonisation fixed by the EU 2050 plan is leading to an increased establishment of renewable energy sources. Additionally, the emergence of power electronics and ICT technologies has played a decisive role towards a novel distribution electric grid allowing new monitoring, operation and control. In parallel to the energetic transition, an increasing occurrence of extreme weather events and a reinforced concern on climate change leads to the concept of resilience, which is the capacity to adapt and recover from disruptive events in a coordinated procedure. After a fault event, assuming the objective of the system operator is to minimize the load unsupplied, the present study aims at outlining an early research state on the concept of self-healing through the development of a power flow optimization algorithm within a meshed network. Moreover, the effects of integrating Distributed Energy Resources (DER) in order to increase distribution grid resilience as well as to ensure and secure power supply to the system leads to the clusterization of the power system. With controllable technologies, the on-outaged areas are able to disconnect from the main grid, creating islanded microgrids (MGs) which can work autonomously and consequently, increase grid resilience. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

Because of several advantages in efficiency and simplicity such as not having to deal with reactive power, DC microgrid is becoming a new trend in microgrid technology. But DC microgrids have an issue when it comes to voltage controlling. A good controlling method is droop controlling although there are other methods. With the decentralized droop controlling method,there are several ways of voltage controlling but they have an issue of load sharing. Hence the sources can be overloaded sometimes. A method of current sharing according to the SoC level to reduce the issue is proposed theoretically in this paper with simulations. © 2018 IEEE.},

Different control strategies have practiced to achieve a balanced and high efficiency from these microgrids. These control strategies have coped to cover intermittent in the generation and operations of these microgrids, but even though a way far to achieve sustainability.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for optimizing the operation of Industrial MicroGrids (IMG). The proposed framework consists of three levels. At the first level, a Profit Based Security Constrained Unit Commitment (PB-SCUC) is solved in order to minimize the total expected cost of IMG via maximizing the IMG revenue by transacting in the day-ahead power market and optimizing the scheduling of the units. In this paper, the tendency of IMG for participating in the day-ahead power market is modelled as a quadric function. At the second level, a Security Constrained Unit Commitment is solved at the upper grid for minimizing the upper grid operation and guaranteeing its security. At this level, the accepted IMG bids in the day-ahead power market would be determined. Finally, at the third level, the IMG operator must settle its units on the basis of its accepted bids. Therefore, a rescheduling problem is solved in the third level. Notably, Renewable Energy Sources (RESs), Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, thermal and electrical storage systems are considered in the IMG. As the RESs and day-ahead market price have stochastic behaviours, their uncertainty is taken into account by implementing stochastic programming. Further, different cases for grid-connected and island modes of IMG are discussed, and the advantages of utilizing RES and storage systems are given. The simulation results are provided based on the IEEE 18-bus test system for IMG and IEEE 30-bus test system for the upper grid. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

In Microgrids (MGs), Combined Cooling, Heating and Power (CCHP) units, Electrical Energy Storages (EESs) that are Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and Thermal Energy Storages (TESs) as new technologies can enhance system efficiency, in addition to reducing energy cost and emissions if they are properly managed. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is proposed to minimize energy cost and emissions in residential MGs with considering BESS and TES. In order to preserve system reliability during on-peak periods, the Demand Response (DR) program is also implemented using Time of Use (TOU) energy tariffs and reducible loads to change energy consumption patterns of consumers. As well, PHEVs as active electrical energy storages are considered as an alternative for EES in optimal energy and emissions management. To solve the proposed multi-objective method, the augmented ɛ-constraint, as one of powerful solution algorithms, is used to efficiently obtain the Pareto front solutions. Then, a fuzzy decision maker is used to pick up the best compromising solution. The proposed strategy is evaluated in several scenarios including with/without considering ESSs and TESs in cases of following thermal, electric, and hybrid loads.

	abstract = {To reduce fossil fuel consumption, carbon dioxide emissions, and greenhouse gas emissions, countries all over the world have been gradually directing their attention toward the development and application of microgrids (MGs) that run on renewable energy sources. The MG concept has been gaining increased interest, particularly with respect to distribution systems. On the other hand MGs are equipped with new technologies such as plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, which have become viable alternatives to traditional combustion-engine cars. In this paper the novel optimization method for efficiency maximization in smart MGs in the presence of demand response, was proposed. This method combines a hybrid shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) and intelligent water drop optimization. In this situation, the EV energy storage system (ESS) state of health (SOH) model was considered to adjust the ESS temperature set point. SFLA is a new member of intelligent algorithms and a new member in the family of memetic algorithms. For this purpose, simulation results were made in MATLAB software environment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. In order to verify proposed algorithm, simulations were made along with some conventional optimization methods. The results show that the proposed optimization method, can effectively improve the performance of MG power flow, when it is compared with other methods. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

This fundamental problem is being a key concern for the European Commission because it leads to adverse health and environmental effects. To solve the emission issues, shore-side-power emerges as an initial solution to mitigate the unwanted environmental impact of ships at berth. In addition to this, port development must be in line with the emerging ships technologies as most of the ships are moving forward All-Electric-Ship (AES) concept. However, the use of shore-side-power is still new, although the international standard was recently available, shore-side-power still facing technical challenges like power supply/demand power, different voltage, and frequency level on the ship and port side. Therefore, the integration of microgrid technologies in conventional seaports aims to become the initial step to the future 'green port.' Furthermore, microgrids research has significantly increase self-sustainability for the future port because of their efficient on-site integration and coordination of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, and energy storage system. This challenging solution will provide more benefits to end-users as well as fuel cost savings and high system reliability. © 2018 IEEE.},

In dc microgrids, arc electrical characterizations would be inevitably interfered by switching noises and higher system electric levels, making the arc fault detection more challenging.In this paper, dc series arc faults under the background of different switching noise interferences are conducted through the designed experimental platform firstly. Having analyzing arc faults with the single and multiple switching noise interference sources based on the signal separation method, the influence of switching noises on arc electrical characterizations is discussed. For arc faults with these inference factors, the existing arc fault features used in the resistive system indicate some limitations, leading to new arc fault detection difficulties. Finally, corresponding measures are taken to give the larger arc fault time discovery pulse and better separated arc fault states. The enlarged arc fault differences are of great benefit to improve the detection effectiveness in these complicated scenes. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Battery energy storage systems are fundamental components in microgrids operations, therefore it is important to adopt models suitable to properly evaluate the performance of these electrical systems. Different methodologies for battery modeling have been developed and tested in this work: (i) Empirical model, in which batteries are described by analytic expressions not based on electrochemical processes; (ii) Equivalent electrical circuit model, in which batteries are described in terms of electrical quantities. These approaches allow to adapt the model to different battery technologies: both the emerging Li-ion and the consolidated lead acid are considered in this paper. The proposed models are implemented in the software Poli. NRG, a Matlab based procedure for microgrid sizing developed by Energy Department of Politecnico di Milano. Simulations are based on a real case study relevant to a microgrid in a rural area: Ngarenanyuki Secondary School in Tanzania. The proposed methodology is used to design a new microgrid based on photovoltaic and energy storage system, comparing the results obtained adopting different modeling approaches and different technologies. Eventually, results are critically analyzed and discussed in order to compare accuracy, computational effort, costs and opportunities. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Electricity demand has grown over the past few years and will continue to grow in the future. The increase in electricity demand is mainly due to industrialization and the shift from a conventional to a smart-grid paradigm. The number of microgrids, renewable energy sources, plug-in electric vehicles and energy storage systems have also risen in recent years. As a result, future electricity grids have to be revamped and adapt to increasing load levels. Thus, new complications associated with future electrical power systems and technologies must be considered. Demand-side management (DSM) programs offer promising solutions to these issues and can considerably improve the reliability and financial performances of electrical power systems. This paper presents a review of various initiatives, techniques, impacts and recent developments of the DSM of electrical power systems. The potential benefits derived by implementing DSM in electrical power networks are presented. An extensive literature survey on the impacts of DSM on the reliability of electrical power systems is also provided for the first time. The research gaps within the broad field of DSM are also identified to provide directions for future work. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an overview on different research activities that we did in the recent decade for developing reconfigurable discrete-event systems (RDESs) from initial high-level specification according to user requirements until final low-level deployment in target hardware components. A reconfiguration is any run-time scenario that adapts the system's behavior to any evolution in the related environment by adding or removing services or also configuring their parameters, i.e., their frequency, execution time, or also their location in the considered hardware architecture. Since the development of distributed RDESs under functional and extra-functional constraints is required by experts, we propose a complete methodology that deals first with their initial design with a new general profile named R-UML extending unified modeling language (UML) or also with new specific technology-oriented profiles, the validation of the related models with a new language R-OCL extending object constraint language (OCL), before their transformation to formal formalisms, such as Petri nets, timed automata, or B method for simulation or also formal verification of different properties. The checked models are transformed into OS reconfigurable tasks in the operational level, before applying a co-design methodology under functional, real-time, memory, and energy constraints for minimizing redundancies in tasks and for optimizing the composition of software and hardware parts together. We describe technology-oriented solutions for the scheduling of distributed RDESs by parameterizing tasks and their exchanged messages between multi-speed networked processors. We finish with the real low-level deployment on target hardware devices before applying useful software and hardware tests for checking the delivered system quality. These contributions, published in different journal and conference papers, are applied to different applications in medicine, wireless sensor networks, transportation systems, manufacturing industry, smart grids and microgrids, embedded technologies, and so on. We find significant gains in terms of the system reactivity and flexibility under related constraints. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a new strategy for service restoration of de-energized loads is proposed using advanced technologies of microgrids (MGs) that accommodate distributed energy resources (DERs). In particular, backup distributed generators (DGs), initially used for critical loads within a building, have recently been operated under normal grid conditions while exporting excess power to other loads on the same or different feeders. In addition, smart switches (SSWs) have been installed in a distribution grid to reduce the frequency and duration of power outages. Using flexible communication links, the sensors of the SSWs exchange control and measurement signals with grid management systems, namely, an advanced distribution management system, an MG energy management system, and a DER management system. This paper focuses on developing a methodological framework to determine the operating modes of synchronous-machine DGs and the on-off operation of SSWs, so as to change dynamically the boundaries of MGs that are formed in a distribution grid for fault isolation and load restoration. Simulation case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy is effective in mitigating the influence of a network fault and restoring de-energized loads while successfully maintaining frequency and voltage levels in MGs. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The reliability and resilience of the electrical power grids are essential to industry, economy and society. Microgrids that are able to island from the bulk electrical grid are one technology that may vastly improve electrical power service to customer loads. To achieve these improvements, an islanded microgrid should be able to operate through the loss of one of its generators without shedding electrical load. The loss of one generator will typically result in significant additional loads, including transient overloads, being placed on the remaining generators. There is also the possibility of additional generator tripping during these processes (i.e. cascading failures), which would likely result in the collapse of the microgrid. The novelty of our work consists in incorporating dynamic models of generator controllers into a microgrid optimal dispatch formulation with the ultimate goal to avoid operational failures and ensure the “survivability” of all-inverter microgrids to generator loss and transient overloads. The integration of generator and controller dynamics into the optimal dispatch formulation significantly increases the computational complexity. As we develop algorithms to restore speed of the optimization, our method can be readily implemented into a new operational strategy capable of an unprecedented level of reliability against generator contingencies. In addition, we quantitatively illustrate the effect of the survivability constraints on the microgrid operating costs and how the related trade-off between capital and operating costs should be taken into account at the design stage. The methods developed here also apply to the dispatch of off-grid microgrids. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {A new approach for more energy efficient industrial production processes are smart industrial direct current (DC) microgrids with one or more connections to the alternative current (AC) grid. The advantage of the DC-technology is an easier integration of renewable energies sources and energy storage systems (ESS). Different applications for ESS are possible, for instance an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) for a DC microgrid. Within this paper, a new handling concept for a mains supply failure (e.g. a blackout of the supplying AC grid) with a droop curve control is introduced. In this approach, the droop curve controlling the ESS is adapted, depending on the ESS' state of charge (SoC), which results in a droop curve with a hysteresis. This concept realizes the charging of the ESS only with recuperation energy, that occurs in the DC microgrid during the production process. Thus, all recuperation energy will be kept in the DC microgrid and a transformation of the energy in AC or an energy loss through braking resistors will be avoided. Furthermore, no additional energy is needed to charge the ESS. This increases the energy efficiency of the entire production process. The concept was verified in simulation and validated in experiment and it has shown a DC voltage deviation of less than two percent. © 2019 IEEE.},

In fact, the adoption of smart products may depend on the ability of organizations to offer systems that ensure adequate sensor data integrity while guaranteeing sufficient user privacy. In light of these challenges, previous research indicates that blockchain technology could be a promising means to mitigate issues of data security arising in the IoT. Building upon the existing body of knowledge, we propose a design theory, including requirements, design principles, and features, for a blockchain-based sensor data protection system (SDPS) that leverages data certification. To support this, we designed and developed an instantiation of an SDPS (CertifiCar) in three iterative cycles intented to prevent the fraudulent manipulation of car mileage data. Following the explication of our SDPS, we provide an ex post evaluation of our design theory considering CertifiCar and two additional use cases in the areas of pharmaceutical supply chains and energy microgrids. Our results suggest that the proposed design ensures the tamper-resistant gathering, processing, and exchange of IoT sensor data in a privacy-preserving, scalable, and efficient manner. © 2019 by the Association for Information Systems.},

	abstract = {In this work a new techno-economic framework to model and assess business cases for energy, reserve and novel reliability services provided by Microgrids (MGs) is presented. The framework combines a bespoke Transactive Energy (TE) approach that aims at co-optimizing these potentially conflicting services. In this context, MGs aggregate, coordinate and exploit flexibility from emerging distributed energy resources and multiple energy vectors (e.g., electricity, heat and gas) as a means to partake in different services in response to price signals associated with markets and network needs. For example, MGs can provide reliability services to both the distribution network and their internal customers, owing to their ability to ride through contingencies by operating as islands. Further, MGs could coordinate with the network restoration scheme to reconnect to the network after a contingency occurs, and use their spare generation capacity to restore ‘blocks’ of other affected customers outside the MG. This novel application for MGs to improve network reliability has not yet been quantified from an economic perspective, especially in a TE context where conflicts with other services may arise. In this regard, it is clear that energy, reserve and reliability services may be economically attractive under specific conditions when assessed in isolation. However, their business case is still unclear in a pragmatic context where the provision of given services affects the economic operation of MGs, and may keep them from partaking in other services. On the above premises, this paper proposes a framework that combines a bespoke Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the operation of MGs, and a stochastic approach for simulating nonlinear and dynamic reliability price signals in light of MG reliability contributions assessed through Monte Carlo simulation. The framework is demonstrated on case studies based on pragmatic energy information, a real UK distribution network, sets of price signals for co-optimization of different services, and multi-energy MGs designed with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, Photovoltaic (PV) panels, Gas Boilers (GBs). Thermal Energy Storage (TES) and/or Battery Energy Storage (BES). The results demonstrate that, even though the operation schedule of devices within a MG can change based on the different technologies and price signals under consideration, the services are largely synergistic. This is a key finding, as it demonstrates that, for example, even without price signals from a reliability service the MG will have significant spare export capacity which, if accessible to the DNO, can improve the reliability of customers outside the MG. © 2017 The Authors},

When a number of users increase cloud and fog load also increases and Response Time (RT) is too much high. So it is a big problem to reduce the RT.

In comparison with the traditional hybrid AC-DC microgrid concept, the reconfigurable hybrid AC-DC microgrids provide more flexibility for better supporting consumers and reducing the operation costs through the remotely controlled switches. In addition, the reconfigurable structure of the hybrid microgrid along with the vehicle-to-grid technology supports the high penetration of plug-in electric vehicles by changing their role from only consuming loads into mobile storages. The proposed problem is prepared as a constrained multi-objective problem optimizing both cost and emission objectives. Due to the high complication and nonlinearity of the problem, an effective optimization algorithm called the theta-crow search algorithm is developed to solve the problem optimally. Also, a stochastic framework based on the point estimate method is used to model the high uncertainties of the problem.

At the early stage of microgrid development, for the sake of the cost and benefit issue, it is necessary for the government to subsidize so as to support and promote the development of microgrids. However, a big challenge in practice is how to optimize the operational efficiency of the microgrid industry chain with varying targets and methods of subsidy. In order to explore this problem, we construct a subsidy model based on the microgrid industry chain, involving government, investor, operator, equipment supplier, and user. Through calculation and solution of this model, we obtain price and return indicators of each microgrid industry chain participant when the subsidy target differs. Based on that, we contrast and compare the optimal subsidy strategy and influencing factors when operational efficiency indicators vary. Finally, we validate and analyze this model with numerical analysis and discuss the impact of development stage, technological level, and change in subsidy amount on the operational efficiency of the microgrid industry chain and on the returns of each participant. This result is of great significance to subsidy practice for microgrids and the development of microgrids. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Power theories are advancing signal decomposition approaches used for electrical power signal analysis. Currently, they are key tools for designing reliable and efficient power electronic interface controllers. Due to the inherent uncertainty in the power generation within new technology of distributed generation units (such as renewable-based microgrids), most of these theories are not directly applicable in the era of new power engineering systems. Furthermore, the traditional formulations are not appropriate once we face the nonlinearity in the consumption along a weak grid that may not maintain steady voltage or frequency. Therefore, a new signal decomposition method with a higher level of selectivity must be developed to modify the traditional power theories and improve the control strategies from a design viewpoint. This paper describes a novel formulation of an instantaneous power theory, enhanced instantaneous power theory (EIPT), for unbalanced and nonlinear three-phase power systems. EIPT establishes a proper decomposition of current components for cases of balanced, unbalanced, and distorted voltage sources. In addition to mathematical analysis, this research provides comprehensive simulations under different loads and source conditions, which supports the performance of the EIPT in the active filtering methods. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method is compared with the state-of-the-art approach widely known as the conservative power theory. Our results indicate that this new comprehensive approach is helpful in optimizing control strategies for power electronic interfaces and power quality compensators. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microgrids can operate either connected to the utility grid or disconnected, respectively called grid-connected and islanding mode. If an emergency occurs, a rapid transition to islanding mode is executed to evaluate the cause of problem and to prevent further damage. However, seamless transition control is not realizable because of speed constraints introduced by the communication protocols being used today. This paper reviews the current technologies applied in a microgrid communication system and presents a new study to solve this problem using EtherCAT, a real-time Ethernet protocol. The advantages of this solution with respect to the state-of-the-art are summarized. We also conducted a performance analysis using minimum cycle time as the performance index to verify the feasibility of EtherCAT in a microgrid application. Potential future work is suggested related to integration of EtherCAT in an actual microgrid system for practical field experiments. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the pressure to transition towards a fully renewable energy system increasing, a new type of power system architecture is emerging: the microgrid. A microgrid integrates a multitude of decentralised renewable energy technologies using smart energy management systems, in order to efficiently balance the local production and consumption of renewable energy, resulting in a high degree of flexibility and resilience. Generally, the performance of a microgrid increases with the number of technologies present, although it remains difficult to create a fully autonomous microgrid within economic reason (de Graaf F, New strategies for smart integrated decentralised energy systems, 2018). In order to improve the selfsufficiency and flexibility of these microgrids, this research proposes integrating a neighbourhood microgrid with an urban agriculture facility that houses a decoupled multi-loop aquaponics facility. This new concept is called Smarthood, where all Food–Water–Energy flows are circularly connected. In doing so, the performance of the microgrid greatly improves, due to the high flexibility present within the thermal mass, pumps and lighting systems. As a result, it is possible to achieve 95.38% power and 100% heat self-sufficiency. This result is promising, as it could pave the way towards realising these fully circular, decentralised Food–Water–Energy systems. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2019, corrected publication 2020.

	abstract = {The study and development of technologies to facilitate efficient operation of microgrids has recently gained momentum. The Electric Spring is one of the new power electronics based device which can smoothen power and voltage fluctuations caused by load-generation mismatch in a microgrid. Microgrid is a subsystem of the existing power system with a decentralized control and distributed structure. Therefore, its line impedance varies over a wide range. While utilizing the ES as a reactive power compensation device for voltage regulation, the nature of line impedance (inductive or resistive) of the microgrid has not been taken into consideration in the existing control of the ES. This can result in a considerable deviation from the desired performance. This paper investigates the effects of line impedance on voltage regulation operation by the ES. It is proposed that the ES control needs to be altered according to the nature of the system line impedance. This hypothesis has been validated by simulating a small scale grid connected microgrid with resistive and inductive system line impedances. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the existence of several energetic resources and local production site by consumers a new strategy for managing the distribution of energy is indispensable. This paper aims to develop a simulation platform for energy resources management of a Micro Grids Network to optimize the electricity consumption. Using the remote control systems and data integration from distributed databases the system regulates automatically the distribution following the need of each customer and need of Micro Grid. The solution use an incremental search algorithm based on the total satisfaction of the constraints by priority order. In this paper, as software platform solution, we use the multi-agent system (MAS) technology. This choice is motivated by the functional ability of agents, and their self-adaptation to the environment (i.e. change the feature). The ability of the interaction between the agents and their mobility will define and specify the real-time needs of each Micro Grids according to its production and consumption capacity and the need of its neighbors. The functional architecture of the operating system is based on a graph, where each node can be a customer or producer of energy or both of them associated with list of requirement constraints. We used the principle of Distributed Databases to facilitate communication inter-agents and to optimize the time of data transfer between agents of different Micro Grids and simplified access “on demand” to the data with high availability. Thanks to the distributed databases solution, we can easily integrate the critical data on a data center and improve the response time of readjustment and equilibration of the electricity distribution and consumption. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.},

	abstract = {Internationally developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries are aiming toward energy trilemma (energy security, environmental sustainability, and energy equity). This can be made possible with the integration of renewable energy (RE) sources (mostly solar and wind). However, Reintegration with conventional grids brings with it grid stability issues, unpredictable and unbalanced supply and demand curves, reverse power flows ultimately resulting in blackouts as conventional grids are not ready to handle Reintegration. This is due to intermittent, variable, non-predictable, and location-specific generation profiles of renewables. All these challenges can be addressed using smart grid solutions integrating information and communication technology infrastructure with electricity infrastructure and adding intelligence to the combination. Smart technologies that can be readily implementable to overcome the above-addressed challenges are detailed in the paper. Some of these are demand response with customer engagement through smart meters, prosumers—encouraging customer feeding back to grid during peak demand through rooftop renewables, RE microgrids to feed a particular boundary isolated from conventional grid, smart inverters which act as storage devices and can feed AC back to grid, integrated storage using battery electric vehicles (BEVs), dynamic line rating using PMUs for real-time and enhanced loading and protection of feeders, etc. Benefits added to the utility and consumers of these technologies are discussed in detail. Electric mobility of transport is another key focus area worldwide due to depleting primary fuels and environmental (GHG) concerns. Major challenge to a distribution utility is the increased demand of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and the charging infrastructure required for EVs. Smart solutions result in new business opportunities for distribution utilities using EV charging infrastructure and also benefit the customer through offering credit for feeding back to grid during peak hours and emergency islanding conditions. This is possible through smart integration of EV with conventional grid through two-way (electrical and information) communication between a distribution utility and consumer. This paper highlights the challenges posed by the emergent requirement of EVs and smart grid solutions to overcome the hurdles of peak demand, renewable uncertainty, etc. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

	abstract = {With the increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs) into microgrids, the original operation mode of power generation determined by load demand faces severe challenges due to the uncertainties of the RESs power output. The electric springs(ESs), as an emerging technology has been verified to be effective in enabling load demand to follow power generation and stabilizing fluctuation of RESs output. This paper presents a new mode of economic operation for island microgrids including non-critical loads with embedded electric springs. Its connotation includes that i) the capacity of energy storage can be reduced through the interaction of the energy storage system (ESS) and the electric springs, ii) the electric springs reduce the stress of peak load regulation and operational cost and iii) the demand of microgrids system for ramping ability of generation units is reduced with the buffer of the electric springs. Numerical results show that the coordinated operation between electric springs and energy storage system of microgrids can bring down the investment cost for the ESS and short-term operational cost in the aspect of economic dispatch, reducing requirements for the capacity and ramp ability of the energy storage system in microgrids. Energy buffering can be achieved with lower cost and the load demand can follow power generation in the new operational mode of islanded microgrids using electric springs. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

	abstract = {The European directive “Clean Energy for All Europeans” (November 2016) depicts for 2030 a new scenario for low-voltage distribution grids, where each end-user will have the right to trade energy and offer demand-response in the electrical market, either individually or in aggregation with others. This paradigm shift in the low-voltage electric market became possible due to an increasing penetration of distributed generation, information and communication technology, and power electronics in low-voltage distribution grids. This new scenario can be addressed by making reference to Local Area Energy Networks (E-LANs), that is, energy networks with degrees of scalability, flexibility, reliability, robustness, and readiness similar to LANs of digital devices, which may represent the basic tile of a larger patchwork, the Internet of Energy. This paper introduces an optimal control approach of E-LANs that applies to poly-phase grids of whatever structure, complexity, variety of power sources and storage units, and multiplicity of connection to utilities. The proposed control can adapt to end users’ attitude, ensure full exploitation of distributed energy sources, and prevent overstress of distribution infrastructure. The control operation is demonstrated by referring to a couple of application examples considering both steady-state and transient conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new hybrid control system for an AC microgrid. The system uses both centralised and decentralised strategies to optimize the microgrid energy control while addressing the challenges introduced by current technologies and applied systems in real microgrid infrastructures. The well-known 3-level control (tertiary, secondary, primary) is employed with an enhanced hierarchical design using intelligent agent-based components in order to improve efficiency, diversity, modularity, and scalability. The main contribution of this paper is dual. During normal operation, the microgrid central controller (MGCC) is designed to undertake the management of the microgrid, while providing the local agents with the appropriate constraints for optimal power flow. During MGCC fault, a peer-to-peer communication is enabled between neighbouring agents in order to make their optimal decision locally. The initial design of the control structure and the detailed analysis of the different operating scenarios along with their requirements have shown the applicability of the new system in real microgrid environments. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Effective Energy Management with an active Demand Response (DR) is crucial for future smart energy system. Increasing number of Distributed Energy Resources (DER), local microgrids and prosumers have an essential and real influence on present power distribution system and generate new challenges in power, energy and demand management. A relatively new paradigm in this field is transactive energy (TE), with its value and market-based economic and technical mechanisms to control energy flows. Due to a distributed structure of present and future power system, the Internet of Things (IoT) environment is needed to fully explore flexibility potential from the end-users and prosumers, to offer a bid to involved actors of the smart energy system. In this paper, new approach to connect the market-driven (bottom-up) DR program with current demand-driven (top-down) energy management system (EMS) is presented. Authors consider multi-agent system (MAS) to realize the approach and introduce a concept and standardize the design of new Energy Flexometer. It is proposed as a fundamental agent in the method. Three different functional blocks have been designed and presented as an IoT platform logical interface according to the LonWorks technology. An evaluation study has been performed as well.

	abstract = {To meet the fast-growing energy demand and, at the same time, tackle environmental concerns resulting from conventional energy sources, renewable energy sources are getting integrated in power networks to ensure reliable and affordable energy for the public and industrial sectors. However, the integration of renewable energy in the ageing electrical grids can result in new risks/challenges, such as security of supply, base load energy capacity, seasonal effects, and so on. Recent research and development in microgrids have proved that microgrids, which are fueled by renewable energy sources and managed by smart grids (use of smart sensors and smart energy management system), can offer higher reliability and more efficient energy systems in a cost-effective manner. Further improvement in the reliability and efficiency of electrical grids can be achieved by utilizing dc distribution in microgrid systems. DC microgrid is an attractive technology in the modern electrical grid system because of its natural interface with renewable energy sources, electric loads, and energy storage systems. In the recent past, an increase in research work has been observed in the area of dc microgrid, which brings this technology closer to practical implementation. This paper presents the state-of-the-art dc microgrid technology that covers ac interfaces, architectures, possible grounding schemes, power quality issues, and communication systems. The advantages of dc grids can be harvested in many applications to improve their reliability and efficiency. This paper also discusses benefits and challenges of using dc grid systems in several applications.

A variety of challenges need to be overcome for these MGs to be successful varying from stability, power quality to protection, and management. Since the various control strategies are actively being researched and emerging challenges still being addressed, there has been a lot of interest related to the aspect of testing. The ever-increasing complexity of control mechanisms invokes the need for safer, faster yet reliable testing methods, which do not compromise on the degree of detail and at the same time are economical and require the minimum testing time. Off-line simulation, real-time (RT) simulation, hardware in the loop simulation, RT emulation, hardware test beds, pilot plants, and other integrated approaches are the major methods for testing in MGs. This paper gives an overview of the testing techniques and discusses the trends in the various technologies employed for testing MGs. First, the various methods are briefly discussed and a comparison is provided. Next, the various research efforts carried out on the aspect of MG testing are categorized and presented one-by-one. Furthermore, new methodologies and emerging approaches for the testing have also been highlighted, and the challenges and future research avenues have been presented. © 2013 IEEE.},

Recently, cleaner power sources (i.e. gas turbines, fuel cell, solar and wind power), energy storage, advanced control and power/energy management are introduced to meet the new requirement, and therefore, making shipboard power system more like a microgrid. In this paper, a frequency-division based power sharing method is proposed to solve the contradiction between fuel efficiency and dynamic load conditions of marine vessels. With effective design, the operation point of prime movers can be maintained at their optimal area, meanwhile, different energy storages will provide characteristic based response. On the basis of the proposed power sharing method, voltage restoration and power management-level control methods are also introduced to form hierarchical control design. A study case is modeled and HIL simulations are carried out to verify the proposed control strategies. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Our power system is evolving in the form of small entities called Microgrids. In this scenario, different renewable and conventional energy sources are integrated together to form the Microgrid and to satisfy a specific load. The frequency is an indication of the balance between the generation and the demand. In the conventional power system, the generators are used to balance the frequency. The emerging new technologies such as the Plug-in-Electric vehicles can play a great role in the stability of the load frequency control system. In this paper, the stability of a Microgrid with plug-in-electric vehicles and communication delay is investigated. The Microgrid controller communicates wirelessly with the plug-in electric vehicle and they form a kind of time delay system. A Microgrid model with plug-in electric vehicles and communication delay is presented in this paper. Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is used to derive stability criterion in form of Linear Matrix Inequalities. Through solving the Linear Matrix Inequalities the maximum time delay that guarantees the stability of the Microgrid is determined. The parameters that affecting the stability and the maximum allowable delay are determined which are; the PI controller gains, the Microgrid inertia, the PEV gain and the PEV time constant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

It requires the involvement of new distributed resources, such as energy storage devices, to smooth power fluctuations of RES and to avoid long-term voltage rises. To achieve the best results such devices should be located as close to the micro source as possible – behind the meter. Small, distributed energy storage devices could be used to increase self-consumption of generated energy inside microgrids, helping also to flatten the daily load curve of the electrical power system (EPS). This paper discusses the properties of selected energy storage technologies suitable for small-scale microgrids containing renewable energy sources. The properties of small Zinc Bromine (ZnBr) flow batteries obtained in experimental research have been presented and compared to the properties of other energy storage devices similarly classified but at a different level of development.

As a result, traditional optimization techniques in new power systems have been seriously influenced during the last decade. One of the most important technical and economical tools in this regard is the Optimal Power Flow (OPF). As a fundamental optimization tool in the operation and planning fields, OPF has an undeniable role in the power system. This paper reviews and compares the OPF approaches mainly related to smart distribution grids. In this work, the main OPF approaches are compared in terms of their objective functions, constraints, and methodologies. Furthermore, computational performances, case study networks and the publication date of these methods are reported.

The character of virtual networks for smart cities is demonstrated based on three pillars: (1) All-IP-based real-time and adaptive broadband communication networks, (2) global navigation satellite systems and their overlay position correction networks, and (3) the interoperability of ubiquitous sensor network applications, as they form the ICT basis for a multitude of applications that are important in smart cities. The heterogeneity of virtual networks for different smart city physical network services is based on these pillars, taking into account the different requirements for the quality of service (QoS) of data packet transmission, geopositioning, and sensor networks. It can be expected that prosumer activities and resultant networked commons become increasingly relevant for the smart city of the future. However, the increasing role of prosumer activities cannot replace the role of markets in solving scarcity problems within ICT networks as well as physical networks. The role of congestion pricing and QoS differentiation for network capacities in transportation and electricity markets as well as ICT is indicated. If, due to non-rivalry in usage, efficient congestion prices are pointless, the future role of subsidies from the state is considered. © The Author(s) 2017.},

This new grid paradigm has arisen to build a flexible electric power system that better coordinates energy resources and loads aiming at efficiently delivering sustainable, economic and secure electricity supplies. As a part of the smart grids (SGs), microgrids (MGs) have been developed to exploit the full benefits from the integration of distributed energy resources, especially distributed renewable generation based on variable and intermittent sources, such as wind and solar. Nevertheless, meeting all these goal requires the implementation of innovative energy storage technologies integrated with high efficiency and very fast response electronic power conditioning systems to interface with the electrical grid. Power electronics systems play a key role in regulating the raw energy from energy storage systems (ESSs) and connecting to the electrical grid. Hence, this paper performs a comprehensive analysis of major technologies in electrical energy storage systems and their electronic interface for applications in smart grids.

	abstract = {The exploitation of renewable energy resources poses great challenges regarding the manner in which they can be integrated into the modern electrical distribution infrastructure. To understand the difficulties of integration of Distributed Generation (DG) in a electricity distribution network, the analyses and result of the effects on aspects of power quality are provided. As, the problem of failure defects in networks and how DG grid connection affects voltage control at both medium-voltage (MV) and low-voltage (LV) levels. Results demonstrated that a communication system between all generators protective systems, a selective protective system, a tracking of perturbations system to isolate failure defects, and a phase control system between the generators and the network. Also synchronizing voltage regulation is crucial for guaranteeing the quality of the power supply. Currently, recent and modern technologies allow different services to share a single communications infrastructure while guaranteeing the required levels of security, reliability, and efficiency. This chapter aims to provide a Smart City (SC) project, implemented in the city of Malaga, Spain, where the integration of the applications of Smart Grid (SG) and the Use Cases (UCs) for the different functionalities of SG have been developed. The SC architecture proposed envisions a hierarchical, distributed, and autonomous structure to address the challenge of smart distribution grids. As a result of this project, new levels of standardisation of languages and protocols and new interconnection functions will be required. These functions will allow smart devices to recognise each other so that they can reconnect in case of failure regardless of the state of the network topology. In conclusion, Renewable Energy Sources (RES) can be optimally integrated into the distribution grid. Generation can approach consumption through the installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels and mini-wind generators, with the reuse of electrical infrastructure. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Hybridizing AC and DC at the distribution level brings the merits of AC and DC together as a valuable future layout for AC and DC technologies. Nevertheless, most recent AC/DC distributed resources and loads are converter-based resulting in low inertia. Further, the future distribution systems will allow investors and customers to plug their energy resources in and out. Such systems with a high penetration of converters and plug-and-play capability will have their own operational philosophy. During islanding in particular, loadability maximization is more pronounced due to the limited resources and being susceptible to any sudden and slow load/supply variations. Thus, the target of the system operator might be to increase the system steady-state stability margin by running OPF. In this work, the AC/DC OPF problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem, and solved by Interior Point method. The newly formulated OPF algorithm is tested on a modified 38-bus AC/DC hybrid microgrid. The developed AC/DC OPF can be a powerful tool for system planners and operators to explore the technical and economic challenges related to hybridizing the AC distribution systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The subsidy feed in tariff policy, which has been adopted in the past few years, for accelerating renewable energy investments, cannot be retained as a sustainable business model for the future smart energy grid. This is mainly due to the fact that this policy increases the energy cost, especially when the amount of the energy generated by renewable sources is not negligible compared to the traditional ones, as is expected for the near future. Additionally, the current centralized electricity market prevents small or very small energy producers, who usually generate energy by renewable means - photovoltaic units or wind turbines - to participate. There is a role for energy aggregators to act on behalf of these small prosumers so that they could sell their excess energy collectively in order to get a better price. To help the tasks of the aggregator a trading tool is required that will facilitate the clustering of prosumers who are able to offer energy at a certain time during the day based on contractual agreements. The VIMSEN project is set-up to produce such a system that will allow the aggregator to select prosumers and form virtual micro-grids by virtue of smart communication systems. VIMSEN is part of the European R&D 7th Framework Programme with the aims to develop, implement and demonstrate a new energy management and business model system using the concept of virtual microgrids, to enable an increase in the market participation of prosumers at neighbourhood and community levels. © 2015 IEEE.},

In this paper, a new control scheme is presented for the implementation of the ES, in conjunction with noncritical building loads like electric heaters, refrigerators, and central air conditioning system. This control scheme would be able to provide power factor correction of the system, voltage support, and power balance for the critical loads, such as the building's security system, in addition to the existing characteristics of ES of voltage and power stability. The proposed control scheme is compared with original ES's control scheme where only reactive power is injected. The improvised control scheme opens new avenues for the utilization of the ES to a greater extent by providing voltage and power stability and enhancing the power quality in the renewable energy powered microgrids. © 2017 IEEE.},

So there are numerous centres of photovoltaic generation distributed throughout the country. This scenario supports the creation and development of new energy contexts such as Net Zero Energy Cluster and DC micro-grids. These new energy models base their success on communication and cooperation among various devices and technologies used. In the near future, the data exchange between network devices will allow real time schedule and management of energy generation and consumption. Innovative devices are required to monitor and communicate energetic production data, signaling a fault or alarm condition, to reconfigure parts of the plant in particular operating conditions. In this paper, a new concept of Smart Maximum Power Point Tracking converter is presented. In details, the DC-DC converter adopted to optimize photovoltaic module energetic performances is exploited to provide users and grid operators with additional services, such as data monitoring and transmission, burglar and fire alarms, matrix reconfiguration, diagnostics, etc. A hierarchical architecture of Smart Maximum Power Point Tracking converters for Net Zero Energy Buildings and DC microgrids performance optimization is presented. © 2016 IEEE.},

It requires involving of new distributed resources like energy storage devices for smoothing power fluctuations of RES and to avoid of long-term voltage rising. To achieve best results they should be located as close to micro source as possible - behind the meter. Small, distributed energy storage devices help increasing self-consumption of energy generated inside microgrids causing also flattening of daily load curve of electrical power system (EPS). This paper discusses the properties of selected energy storage technologies suitable for small-scale microgrids containing renewable energy sources. Especially, the properties of small Zinc Bromine (ZnBr) flow battery obtained in experimental research have been presented and compared to the properties of other energy storage devices classified to similar classes but being on different maturity and development level. The simple equivalent model of ZnBr battery has been developed and described as well. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In this paper, an optimization problem is formulated for the automatic back-feed service restoration in smart distribution grids. The formulated problem relies on the structure of smart distribution grids, clustered into multi-microgrids, capable of operating in both grid-connected and islanded modes of operation. To that end, three types of power transfer between the neighboring microgrids, during the restoration processes are introduced: load transfer, distributed generation (DG) transfer, and combined load–DG transfer. The formulated optimization problem takes into account the ability of forming new, not predefined islanded microgrids, in the post-restoration configuration, to maximize service restoration. To obviate the need for a central unit, the optimization problem is reformulated, in this work, as a distributed constraint optimization problem, in which the variables and constraints are distributed among automated agents. To reduce the problem complexity, the restoration problem is decomposed into two sequential and interdependent distributed sub-problems: supply adequacy, and optimal reconfiguration. The proposed algorithm adopts the Optimal Asynchronous Partial Overlay (OPTAPO) technique, which is based on the distributed constraint agent search to solve distributed sub-problems in a multi-agent environment. Several case studies have been carried out to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Distributed photovoltaic (PV) system is playing an increasingly significant role in the fast growing global PV market, as a renewable power supply source. In rural and remote areas, the integrated PV technology with remote micro-grid offers a potential solution for agriculture and small businesses to access to clean, reliable and efficient energy source. As the cost of solar PV modules continues to show a downward tendency, the distributed PV systems with remote micro-grid are capable to meet growing energy demand with affordable price. Meanwhile, a series of policies and actions have been enacted in China since 2013, to motivate the distributed-generation PV development as equal as large-scale PV development. However, compared to coal-fired power plants or large-scale PV systems, a barrier exists in securing financing of distributed PV systems, which has high up-front costs and the risk of commercializing renewable energy initiatives. Under current market incentives and barriers, this paper studies the existing financing methods in distributed PV systems with remote distributed micro-grids. In comparison with other financing sources, a case study approach is employed with distributed PV water pumping system in China to introduce crowd-funding as a new source of financing in distributed PV systems. Through the SWOT analysis, this paper identifies a capacity for new financial approach of crowd-funding with PVWP deployment. The scenario is modelled for different stakeholders and organization forms that target social network interactions in crowd-funding, and the results provide insights for incentives and policy. © 2016 The Authors.},

This can be used as a metric for comparative analysis for new batteries, with an undeveloped market. The energy requirements for the components are quantified and are compared in terms of energy payback time (EPBT) and Net Energy Ratio (NER). All the calculations are done for Indian context. EPBT is found to be in the range of 2–4.5 years for all the systems, while NER is in the range of 6.6–2.52. NaS has the highest emission factor of 0.67 kgCO2/kWh and the least for NiCd (0.091 kgCO2/kWh).

	abstract = {The main challenge in integrating a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) into a microgrid is to evaluate an optimum size of BESS to prevent the microgrid from instability and system collapse. The installation of BESS at a random size or non-optimum size can increase in cost, system losses and larger BESS capacity. Thus, this paper proposes the new method to evaluate an optimum size of BESS at minimal total BESS cost by using particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based frequency control of the stand-alone microgrid. The research target is to propose an optimum size of BESS by using the PSO method-based frequency control in order to prevent the microgrid from instability and system collapse after the loss of the utility grid (e.g., blackout or disasters) and minimize the total cost of BESS for 15 years installation in the microgrid. Then, the economical performance of BESS with modern different storage technologies is investigated and compared in the typical microgrid. Results show that the optimum size of BESS-based PSO method can achieve higher dynamic performance of the system than the optimum size of BESS-based analytic method and the conventional size of BESS. In terms of BESS economical performance with modern storage technologies, the installation of the polysulfide-bromine BESS is likely to be more cost-effective than the installation of the vanadium redox BESS for 15 years installation in the typical microgrid. It is concluded that the proposed PSO method-based frequency control can improve significantly power system stability, grid security, and planning flexibility for the microgrid system. At the same time, it can fulfill the frequency control requirements with a high economic profitability. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Li–air batteries have potential to be the next generation power sources for various applications, from portable devices to electric vehicles and microgrids, due largely to their significantly higher theoretical energy densities than those of the existing batteries. The commercialization of this technology, however, is hindered by a variety of technical hurdles, including low obtainable capacity, poor energy efficiency, and limited cycle life. Breakthrough to these barriers requires a fundamental understanding of the complex electrochemical and transport behaviors inside the batteries. Mathematical modeling and simulation are imperative in gaining important insight into the mechanisms of these complex phenomena, which is vital to achieving rational designs of better materials for high-performance batteries. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the latest advances in modeling and simulation of Li–air batteries and offer our perspectives on new directions of future development. Unlike previous reviews that centered mainly on continuum modeling of non-aqueous Li–air batteries, the present paper focuses on mathematical descriptions of the detailed transport and electrochemical processes in different types of Li–air batteries. We start with a brief introduction to the working principles of Li–air batteries. Then, the governing equations for mass transport and electrochemical reactions in non-aqueous Li–air batteries are formulated, including lithium ion and oxygen transport in the porous air electrode, the formation of solid discharge products, the kinetics of electrode reactions, the evolution of electrode structure, the distribution of active sites, the effect of the side reactions during cycling, the phenomena of the volume change, and the charge process. In addition, the mo\deling and simulations of aqueous and hybrid Li–air batteries are reviewed, highlighting the phenomena that are different from those in the non-aqueous ones. Finally, the challenges facing the modeling and simulation of Li–air batteries are discussed and perspectives for the development of a new generation of Li–air batteries are outlined. © 2017},

	abstract = {DC microgrids (MGs) have been gaining a continually increasing interest over the past couple of years both in academia and industry. The advantages of dc distribution when compared to its ac counterpart are well known. The most important ones include higher reliability and efficiency, simpler control and natural interface with renewable energy sources, and electronic loads and energy storage systems. With rapid emergence of these components in modern power systems, the importance of dc in today's society is gradually being brought to a whole new level. A broad class of traditional dc distribution applications, such as traction, telecom, vehicular, and distributed power systems can be classified under dc MG framework and ongoing development, and expansion of the field is largely influenced by concepts used over there. This paper aims first to shed light on the practical design aspects of dc MG technology concerning typical power hardware topologies and their suitability for different emerging smart grid applications. Then, an overview of the state of the art in dc MG protection and grounding is provided. Owing to the fact that there is no zero-current crossing, an arc that appears upon breaking dc current cannot be extinguished naturally, making the protection of dc MGs a challenging problem. In relation with this, a comprehensive overview of protection schemes, which discusses both design of practical protective devices and their integration into overall protection systems, is provided. Closely coupled with protection, conflicting grounding objectives, e.g., minimization of stray current and common-mode voltage, are explained and several practical solutions are presented. Also, standardization efforts for dc systems are addressed. Finally, concluding remarks and important future research directions are pointed out. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Data acquisition and supervisory control are usually performed using client-server architecture and centralized control in conventional power systems. However, the message transmission and fault clearing are too slow for large-scale complex power systems. Microgrid systems have various types of distributed energy resources (DERs) which are quite different in characteristics and capacities, thus, the client-server architecture and centralized control are inadequate to control and operate in microgrids. Based on MATLAB/Simulink (ver.R2012a) simulation software and Java Agent Development Framework (JADE) (JADE 4.1.1-revision 6532), this paper proposes a novel fault protection technology that used multi-agent system (MAS) to perform fault detection, fault isolation and service restoration in microgrids. A new topology identification method using the YBus Matrix Algorithm is presented to successfully recognize the network configurations. The identification technology can respond to microgrid variations. Furthermore, the interactive communications among intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), circuit breakers (CBs), and agents are clarified during fault occurrence. The simulation results show that the proposed MAS-based microgrids can promptly isolate faults and protect the system against faults in real time.},

	abstract = {Access to clean, modern energy services is an essential requirement for sustainable development. The UN Sustainable Development Goals and SE4ALL program call for universal access to modern energy services by 2030. However, the latest available figures estimate that 1.1 billion people are living without access to electricity with over 55% living in Sub-Saharan Africa. Furthermore, 90% live in rural areas, often with challenging terrain, low income and population density, or in countries with severe underinvestment in electricity infrastructure making grid extension impractical. Recently, technological and cost improvements with new business models have made mini-grids combining multiple energy technologies one of the most promising alternatives for off-grid electrification. The International Energy Agency has estimated that between 100,000 to 350,000 new mini-grids will be required to reach universal access goals. Given the intermittent and location dependent nature of renewable energy sources and the various cost dynamics of included technologies, detailed system operations and demand modelling are required to determine the cost optimal combinations of technologies for each particular local context. The model presented in this paper simulates hourly mini-grid operation using meteorological data, demand profiles, technology capabilities, and costing data to determine the optimal component sizing of a hybrid mini-grid appropriate for rural electrification. The model is designed to be fully transparent, reproducible, scalable, customizable and uses freely available software and data. © 2017 Cape Peninsula University of Technology.},

	abstract = {The massive penetration of renewable energy sources in the utility grid has emerged as the solution to obtain clean energy in modern electric systems, which are gradually replacing their generators that produce CO2 emissions to achieve a sustainable growing. Power electronics is quite relevant in the deep penetration of renewable energy, because the use of such equipment is mandatory to integrate these new resources with the existing facilities. In order to reach higher power ranges, multilevel topologies are the state-of-the-art solution, due to the limited rating of the actual semiconductor devices. Furthermore, latest trends show that asymmetric multilevel configurations are an attractive technology to connect directly the power converters to the grid. This paper analyze the photovoltaic energy injection to microgrids using a hybrid approach that mixes the existing topologies: string, multistring and central inverter to implement an asymmetric structure that generate highly sinusoidal resulting waveforms. This document includes a simple analysis of the proposed configuration and highlights the advantages of using an asymmetric converter, supported with stationary and dynamic simulated results. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microgrids (MGs) and their enabling technologies (e.g. small-scale renewable energy generation, energy storage systems, demand response, and information and communication systems) have attracted increasing attention in the past few years as they are expected to play an important role in future sustainable energy systems. There is a significant research gap in how to plan and manage energy systems with growing numbers of MGs. In this study, an energy system expansion planning (EP) model is used to investigate the quantitative impacts of MGs on energy system sustainability. The EP design problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem with a range of technical constraints such as AC power flow, reliability, and power quality constraints, as well as including variable and fixed costs. Several case studies are undertaken on electricity networks in New South Wales, Australia. The results confirm that MGs can significantly improve a system's efficiency. However, this efficiency improvement is influenced by factors such as the ratio of the MG participation, the network topology, and other specific power system constraints. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {Within the context of microgrids, the need for a smart energy management system (EMS) has become increasingly important for users to maximise use of local energy generation and/or trade power effectively with the energy market if there is a grid connection. Many researchers have been developing algorithms to forecast the availability of renewable energy and load demands whilst optimising the energy flows within required constraints. Recently, control systems for peer-to-peer (P2P) microgrid architectures, which involve complex information and communication technologies, have also been given much attention. However, not all of these algorithms have been implemented and tested with real hardware, which may be attributed to the high cost involved and the safety concerns of a larger system. This paper describes the design, build and demonstration of a scaled down (100 W) P2P microgrid system to provide a low cost, modular, safe, portable testing environment for new EMS algorithms. The system nonetheless has realistic behaviour in terms of control interfaces, measurements and dynamics, and therefore provides a valuable insight into EMS implementation that cannot be obtained through simulations alone. In this work, three microgrid emulators were built and they can communicate with each other via TCP/IP, enabling development and demonstrations of distributed forecasting, control and optimisation algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.},

EVs is a new, promising, technology which will offer cleaner and more effective means of transportation. On the other hand, EVs can also act as storage devices, thus offering ancillary services to the grid. The optimum operation of Low Voltage (LV) grids, with special emphasis on Smart Microgrids (SM), must be ensured and the financial viability of EVs' penetration is to be assessed. Smart Microgrids seem to be the best solution for the management of modern LV grids with Distributed Energy Resources (DER). The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the economic benefits that can arise from the coordinated control of DER and EVs in SM operation. Absence of distributed resources, and therefore satisfaction of the full load from the upstream network, is considered as the base case. Various pricing policies based on System Marginal Prices (SMPs) are considered. For each scenario, three different charging technologies are examined. All different cases are compared between them to determine which one is the most advantageous in terms of operational cost. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {In remote microgrids, the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) is essential to meet the demand in conjunction with the dispatchable fuel-based generation units. The need to facilitate RES efficiently and the very high cost of fuel transportation in these areas make installing battery energy storage system (BESS) an appealing solution. However, the high cost of BESS requires optimizing the BESS technology selection and size to increase their benefits to the microgrid. In this paper, the optimal BESS installation decisions are determined from the perspective of an investor with the objective of profit maximization. The maximum size of BESS that the investor is willing to install for a certain discharge price is determined for various BESS technologies. Also, a new approach to determine the minimum acceptable discharge price at which the installation would make profit for the investor is proposed. Thereafter, the optimal microgrid and BESS operation is determined to minimize the total microgrid costs while meeting its growing demand considering the installation decisions obtained from the proposed investment model. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

	abstract = {A new energy management system is proposed in this paper to optimally schedule different generation technologies in hybrid AC/DC microgrid for remote communities. The proposed scheme relies on a microgrid controller (MGC), which minimizes the operational costs for different distributed generation (DG) units in the islanded microgrid by sending droop characteristics parameters to the DG units to ensure optimum power sharing for each time slot. Moreover, the MGC controls the customers' appliances and water desalination units to ensure optimal utilization of the system assets with minimum operational costs while satisfying the customer requirements. In addition, the MGC sends operational parameters for the interlinking converters between the AC and DC subsystems to ensure stable operation of the microgrid by controlling power exchange between the AC and DC sides. The energy management problem is formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming, which is solved by the MGC. Optimal decisions are sent to local controllers and smart meters to be implemented. Simulation results on an islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid are provided. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach. © 2017 IEEE.},

Power system resilience characterizes the ability to resist, adapt to, and timely recover from disruptions. The resilient power system is intended to cope with low probability, high risk extreme events including extreme natural disasters and man-made attacks. With an increasing awareness of such threats, the resilience of power systems has become a top priority for many countries. Facing the pressing urgency for resilience studies, the objective of this paper is to investigate the resilience of power systems. It summarizes practices taken by governments, utilities, and researchers to increase power system resilience. Based on a thorough review on the existing metrics system and evaluation methodologies, we present the concept, metrics, and a quantitative framework for power system resilience evaluation. Then, system hardening strategies and smart grid technologies as means to increase system resilience are discussed, with an emphasis on the new technologies such as topology reconfiguration, microgrids, and distribution automation; to illustrate how to increase system resilience against extreme events, we propose a load restoration framework based on smart distribution technology. The proposed method is applied on two test systems to validify its effectiveness. In the end, challenges to the power system resilience are discussed, including extreme event modeling, practical barriers, interdependence with other critical infrastructures, etc. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

One potential application is the integration with the railway infrastructures as a new green technology. This goal will be achieved by proposing heuristic technique to enable interconnected MGs to work transparently with the recent energy storage. Railway transportation MG model is proposed to balance energy flows between trains moving and braking energy, energy storage system and a main power utility network. The paper proposes an energy optimization tool for the interconnected railway-MG system. Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) is applied for achieving the economical cost during the operation.

The new control strategy has something in common with RAC. First, the control parameters remain unchanged in all controllers. Second, power balance and system frequency can be restored automatically and autonomously (no communication or dispatching center order is needed during this process). Aside from these, the new control strategy has other merits. The load change can be shared nearly in proportion to voltage source inverter (VSI) rated capacity under the new mode. The sharing ratio is acceptable when complex topology and highly resistive lines are used in microgrid.

	abstract = {Today cities house half of the world's population, and they are set to host three quarters in 2050 considering that urbanization is only set to increase. Cities represent three quarters of world energy consumption and 80% of CO2 emissions worldwide being the most critical of any environmental policy challenge. To cope with this continued urban growth we will need to invent new ways to manage cities and make them more effective. The convergence between the world of energy and digital technologies, will pave the way for a new ecosystem of services which should enable both reduced energy consumption and a better quality of life. The energy sector will see in the upcoming years an increasing numbers of consumers producing their own energy, not only sharing it with one another but also customizing it for their own personal use. Digital technologies, after revolutionizing the information technology sector, are now transforming all economic sectors, including energy. In this paper the main issues related to smart grids and their integration with the cities will be analyzed stressing the importance to dispose of simulation tools and models aimed at facilitating pre-feasibility and feasibility analysis of smarter energy technologies. A simplified tool is under development to introduce the microgrid and distributed power systems designs. The tool takes in account both conventional and renewable energy technologies and it is designed to simulate microgrids or as distributed generation within a larger grid. The first results of the tool have been compared with experimental results and with data from literature and used to perform simulations of various systems. As case study, some results regarding the integration of a battery energy storage system in the grid are reported. © 2016 IEEE.},

As affordability of renewable energy technologies (RET) increases, cities and urban regions become the venues, not only for energy consumption but also for generation and distribution, which calls for systemic and paradigmatic change in local energy infrastructure. The decentralizing transitions of urban energy systems, particularly solar photovoltaic and thermal technologies, require a comprehensive assessment of their sociotechnical co-evolution - how technologies and social responses evolve together and how their co-evolution affects urban planning and energy policies. So far, urban planning literature has mainly focused on the impact of physical urban forms on efficiency of energy consumption, overlooking how the dynamics of new energy technologies and associated social responses affect local systems of energy infrastructure, the built environments and their residents. This paper provides an interdisciplinary review on the co-evolving technical and social dynamics of DES focusing on Distributed Generation (DG), MicroGrids (MG), and Smart MicroGrids (SMG), in order to draw insights for their integration in urban planning and policy, in particular reference to climate change mitigation and adaptation planning. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Electric mobility is assuming a central role in the new world energy scenario where Renewable Energy Sources (RES) have increased their contribution to the electricity production, mainly due to the fact they are characterized by a reduced environmental impact; in the aforesaid context, Electric Vehicles (EVs) can play a significant role to facilitate the integration of RES into the power grid, also within smart grid infrastructures. Public administration represents one of the sectors that can mostly benefit from the use of the EV technology in its fleets; in many countries, governments have introduced incentive policies to support the spread of the electric mobility and car manufacturers are developing EVs for urban transportation users. In this paper, the attention is focused on a smart microgrid project developed at the University of Genoa and based on the integration of RES, EVs and storage systems. In particular, the attention is here pointed on the use of the EVs to highlight the different habits of recharge adopted at the Genoa University.

	abstract = {Evolution of energy markets is accelerating in the direction of a greater reliance on energy vectors with renewable energy resources (RERs) being the main components on the playing ground. The energy technologies and new frameworks necessary to manage this two-way power system complexity remain unclear. With increasing energy market in manufacturing industries, smart cities, and government buildings, intelligent energy management systems (IEMSs) are poised to be a tool to facilitate the implementation of the new era on energy system. In fact, the energy market is as diverse as it is large, consisting of buildings of all ages, sectors, and management regimes. Thus, they represent the mechanisms which can enable energy industry to improve performances, save energy, and comply with regional grid codes and laws. Today, the energy market is expanding into adjacent functions such as demand response and property management, broadening their capabilities on the next-generation power distribution networks (PDNs). In order to broaden a set of players in the energy market, this chapter briefly discusses the application of IEMSs in current and future PDNs trends considering the integration of several DERs into the PDNs. Thus, the attention is more directed on utilization of IEMSs in the current and future PDNs with nanogrid (n-grid), microgrid (μ-grid) and virtual power plants (VPPs). Moreover, applications of smart-grid technologies are also presented to show their potential in the PDNs with various DERs operating scenarios. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

	abstract = {Smart grid technology that enables fine-grained monitoring and control of electrical power systems makes it possible to envision new operating strategies and even new business models. Possibilities for leveraging these smart grid tools in the developing world are being explored, particularly with emerging microgrids for rural electrification. In these off-grid systems, smart meters at the residential level are being used to manage the delivery of affordable electricity through novel uses of mobile payments and direct demand-side control at the customer level. In contrast to traditional power systems in the developed world, the available total supply in microgrids, which can incorporate multiple types of generation, is not always sufficient to meet the aggregate demand, even under normal operating conditions. Moreover, both the available supply and the demand are highly variable, limiting the value of deterministic analyses. This paper introduces a simulation tool for assessing the performance of these systems using probabilistic models of supply and demand. A key feature of the tool is the use of stochastic models for the individual loads and supplies, which are aggregated precisely to obtain stochastic models of the system-level behavior. This makes it possible to evaluate and compare system performance for different operating and business strategies that take advantage of the capabilities for fine-grained control. The paper describes the simulator inputs, computations and illustrative results for a case study. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Naval ship power systems are evolving towards more electronics, more "vital" electronic systems, and a larger percentage of the overall energy load needed in the form of electricity. This is due to larger load demands from sensors, future weapons systems, and electrified propulsion. New technologies, such as All-Electric Ships, Integrated Propulsion Systems, and DC-Microgrids, the combination of which is referred to as MVDC, bring the promise of greater flexibility in design and operation, improved system resiliency, and increased energy efficiency. These advancements, however, depend on power electronic devices to control power flow and ensure voltage stability. At points in the power network, power electronic devices can behave as constant power loads (CPLs), which exhibit negative impedance, and at other times can demand large, instantaneous pulses of power. An improperly designed MVDC will become unstable amid large swings in power demand, and the voltage will collapse bringing the entire system down. Through a hierarchical control structure, where ensuring that system stability is maintained at a different level of control than the optimization of the power flow, these challenges can be understood and overcome separately. Different system goals are accomplished at each level in the control hierarchy, and each higher level of control is executed on a successively slower time scale. At the lowest level are current and voltage control for each of the above mentioned devices. The next level involves droop control on the current and voltage set points to ensure stability and up to the moment power balance, and ensures proper voltage regulation at each bus, and the third level focuses on optimization of resources. This paper focuses on the middle level, establishes stability criteria using non-linear techniques, and demonstrates the feasibility using numerical simulation. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The centralised power grid bears a heavy burden in a time when consumers expect an uninterrupted reliable power supply, a reduction in carbon emissions, increased efficiency within the national grid and power supplied to remote communities. As expectations increase, it becomes the task of power systems research and design to develop new structures to meet these demands. This has led to alternatives being sought for centralised power generation, which is prone to outages (due to long distance transmission), is a substantial contributor to global carbon emissions, has large transmission losses and is often not a practical solution when supplying remote communities. Distributed generation (DG) looks to remedy these inadequacies by producing power close to its point of consumption, often utilising carbon neutral, renewable energy (RE) sources (sun, wind). To maximise the efficient use of DG, control structures are used to balance the intermittent RE power production with consumer power consumption. One such structure is used to implement control of small scale DG, at a single house/small building level: the nanogrid. This paper explores the current nanogrid research, it collates the existing definitions and uses the knowledge to give a concise definition of a nanogrid. It then discusses the control topologies and techniques which enable the intelligent control of the nanogrid, before presenting the hardware platform used to ensure the efficient operation of a small scale DG system. The paper then considers the interconnection of multiple nanogrids forming a network (microgrid), facilitating the sharing of power between individual nanogrids. The future developments are then explored before the paper's conclusions are presented. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to security reasons, when assessing long-term planning in isolated microgrids, it is crucial to consider, the system's short-term variability. In this way, the need to develop modelling and planning decision-aid tools for grid managers, towards an optimal integration of renewable energy in isolated microgrids, is emerging. These tools shall combine short-term variability with long-term planning, while addressing multiple smart grid integration challenges. The present work proposes the evolution of an economic dispatch model to an integrated modelling tool, adding planning features. These consist in the implementation and sizing of different renewable and storage energy systems, and the development of demand scenarios, as the introduction of electric vehicles, demand response strategies, and/or residential efficiency measures. Levelized cost of electricity, operation costs, CO2 emissions and renewable shares are quantified. Terceira Island in Azores, is adopted as case study to validate the model. Results show that this tool has a great potential for supporting planning decisions, obtaining valuable parameters to analyze the proposed strategies, as the storage suitability, need of renewable curtailment or cost increase due to electric vehicles deployment. The integrated features allow understanding whether a new technology, besides being technically feasible, is economically viable with respect to the existing system. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

In order to address these emerging challenges, new simulation tools need to be developed to study the influence of renewables, microgrids, distributed generation resources, and the interaction among them. Towards this end, China Southern Power Grid (CSG) developed a new Electromagnetic Simulation Program (ESP) using the state-of-the-art high performance parallel computing technologies. One well-known concern with renewables is the challenge it caused to the voltage control. The intermittent and random nature of renewables cause the voltage to fluctuate in a much more frequent and faster manner, which is difficult to solve with the existing infrastructure. A novel control approach using energy storage system is proposed to solve such issues. This paper presents the modeling of various distributed generators within a microgrid and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm using this newly developed ESP, through which the advanced features of the software is also showcased. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The described environmental assessment deals with processing and analysis of spatial data focused on renewable resources, which are integrated together with other sources of energy in the microgrids. The approach combines a range of technologies including solar photovoltaic, wind power, small-scale hydroelectric systems and bioenergy. GIS is used to support spatial analysis and assessment for siting renewable devices. GIS methods also assist in the evaluation of potential renewable energy from installed developments in relation to solar and wind potential, hydropower capacity and biomass production from energy crops on a regional scale. The region of interest is located in Northwest Bohemia in Europe. Over many decades, the forested and agricultural landscape has been converted into an industrial one. The central part of the studied territory almost completely lacks environmentally sustainable features. Following surface mining, reclamation was performed in order to return strip mines to the approximate original contours of the landscape. Reclamation involves replacement of the overburden using earthmovers, followed by partial restoration of vegetation. The target is transformation of the disturbed sites into forests and agricultural areas, which can support other socioeconomic development and new sustainable energy development. Described research of generating power locally at distribution voltage level by using non-conventional and renewable energy is linked to the service area for each village in the selected region. The service areas are associated with a local road network, which can serve for interconnection with renewable sources of energy for maintenance engineering, crop collection and possible interconnection by power lines. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

Recent applications with grid-integrated buildings and microgrids are extending the functionality, with increasing sophistication of how demand-side load profiles are managed and with integration of distributed storage and generation. This paper reviews the motivation for demand response (DR) and outlines the architectural models, technology infrastructure, and communication and control protocols that are currently in use. Four projects for commercial buildings and microgrids, in the United States, United Kingdom, and China, are described.

	abstract = {Modern society relies heavily upon complex and widespread electric grids. In recent years, advanced sensors, intelligent automation, communication networks, and information technologies (IT) have been integrated into the electric grid to enhance its performance and efficiency. Integrating these new technologies has resulted in more interconnections and interdependencies between the physical and cyber components of the grid. Natural disasters and man-made perturbations have begun to threaten grid integrity more often. Urban infrastructure networks are highly reliant on the electric grid and consequently, the vulnerability of infrastructure networks to electric grid outages is becoming a major global concern. In order to minimize the economic, social, and political impacts of large-scale power system outages, the grid must be resilient in addition of being robust and reliable. The concept of a power system's cyber-physical resilience centers around maintaining critical functionality of the system backbone in the presence of unexpected extreme disturbances. Resilience is a multidimensional property of the electric grid; it requires managing disturbances originating from physical component failures, cyber component malfunctions, and human attacks. In the electric grid community, there is not a clear and universally accepted definition of cyber-physical resilience. This paper focuses on the definition of resilience for the electric grid and reviews key concepts related to system resilience. This paper aims to advance the field not only by adding cyber-physical resilience concepts to power systems vocabulary, but also by proposing a new way of thinking about grid operation with unexpected extreme disturbances and hazards and leveraging distributed energy resources. The concepts of service availability and quality are not new, but many recognize the need of resilience in maintaining essential services to critical loads, for example to allow home refrigerators to operate for food conservation in the aftermath of a hurricane landfall. By providing a comprehensive definition of power system resilience, this paper paves the way for creating appropriate and effective resilience standards and metrics. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {DC power distribution system is being considered as an attractive alternative to its traditional AC counterpart in many fields of applications and, in particular, for maritime onboard power systems. The adoption of DC power architecture would bring a broad range of benefits to the onboard power system. Not only frequency-related constraints are eliminated, which allows high-speed smaller generators to be used, but also new fault-tolerant configurations involving power electronics, generation control, as well as smart systemic management. For these reasons, DC power systems become natural alternative to the conventional AC power systems in the field of future maritime applications. Moreover, the inevitable cabin structure of maritime applications naturally separate the large-scale power system into several zonal parts. Furthermore, it is expected that the zonal parts can maintain autonomous power supply for a short time, which make the system highly consist with DC microgrids. In this content, it is foreseeable that the advanced research outcomes in the field of DC microgrid are also compatible with maritime onboard power systems. In this paper, DC power architectures, control and coordination methods, and specific issues of maritime onboard power system, fuel efficiency optimization and systemic reconfiguration are outlined, referring to state-of-the-art realizations as well as to novel concept designs presently under development and investigation. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a new control strategy for damping of power oscillations in a multisource dc microgrid. A parallel combination of a fuel cell (FC), a photovoltaic system, and a supercapacitor (SC) is used as a hybrid power conversion system (HPCS). The SC compensates for the slow transient response of the FC stack. The HPCS controller comprises a multiloop voltage controller and a virtual impedance loop for power management. The virtual impedance loop uses a dynamic droop gain to actively damp the low-frequency oscillations of the power sharing control unit. The gain of the virtual impedance loop is determined using a small-signal analysis and the pole placement method. The Mesh analysis is employed to further study the stability of low-frequency modes of the overall dc microgrid. Moreover, based on the guardian map theorem, a robust stability analysis is carried out to determine a robustness margin for the closed-loop system. The main advantage of the proposed method is its robustness against uncertainties imposed by microgrid parameters. This feature provides DG units with plug-and-play capability without needing the exact values of microgrid parameters. The performance of the proposed control scheme is verified using hardware-in-the-loop simulations carried out in OPAL-RT technologies. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Microgrid is a distribution system composed of a set of micro-generators which are added to a network. One serious challenge facing a microgrid network is designing a proper protection scheme. This is because the fault current in a microgrid is constantly changing due to the presence of distributed generation (DG) resources at all levels of the distribution network and to the fact that they can operate in two islanding and normal modes. This makes the conventional methods inappropriate for microgrid protection. That is, new schemes should be developed for this purpose. This paper is a summary of studies recently carried out in the field of microgrid protection. Along this line, the structure and topology of microgrids are reviewed first. Afterwards, the protective challenges facing DG-equipped distribution networks are discussed. Then, the innovative methods proposed to solve these problems are analyzed. These methods can be divided up into six main categories: changing settings of protective devices at presence of DG units, disconnecting pertinent DG units when faults occur, creating a balance among different DG technologies, using fault current limiter, using smart transformers, and adaptive protection. In so doing, we consider the factors involved in selecting each method. The factors identified are microgrid type and topology, DG type, communication type and delay time, method of fault detection and analysis, relay type, fault type, method of grounding, and use of smart transformers in microgrid. It is hoped that this work will be useful to the researchers in the field of microgrid protection in finding relevant references and designing appropriate methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Electronic power converters are essential in this kind of architecture in order to interface every element to the system. They introduce controllability into the system and dynamic decoupling. However, the control of these elements from a system-level perspective remains a challenge. The dynamic interaction among the power converters, their variable operation modes, and the lack of information about commercial converters, are some of the factors that complicate an integrated analysis. This work proposes a large-signal black-box modeling approach able to characterize the nonlinear behavior dc/ac converters. The study is particularized to a converter interfacing a renewable source with the grid. Nevertheless, this methodology can be extended to different operating modes. The performance of the model is compared with the detailed switching model of the converter. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed power systems in the U.S. and globally are evolving to provide reliable and clean energy to consumers. In California, existing regulations require significant increases in renewable generation, as well as identification of customer-side Distributed Energy Resources (DER) controls, communication technologies, and standards for interconnection with the electric grid systems. As DER deployment expands, customer-side DER control and optimization will be critical for system flexibility and demand response (DR) participation, which improves the economic viability of DER systems. Current DER systems integration and communication challenges include leveraging the existing DER and DR technology and systems infrastructure, and enabling optimized cost, energy and carbon choices for customers to deploy interoperable grid transactions and renewable energy systems at scale. This paper presents a cost-effective solution to these challenges by exploring communication technologies and information models for DER system integration and interoperability. This system uses open standards and optimization models for resource planning based on dynamic-pricing notifications and autonomous operations within various domains of the smart grid energy system. It identifies architectures and customer engagement strategies in dynamic DR pricing transactions to generate feedback information models for load flexibility, load profiles, and participation schedules. The models are tested at a real site in California-Fort Hunter Liggett (FHL). The results for FHL show that the model fits within the existing and new DR business models and networked systems for transactive energy concepts. Integrated energy systems, communication networks, and modeling tools that coordinate supply-side networks and DER will enable electric grid system operators to use DER for grid transactions in an integrated system. © 2015.},

	abstract = {Recent communication, computation, and technology advances coupled with climate change concerns have transformed the near future prospects of electricity transmission, and, more notably, distribution systems and microgrids. Distributed resources (wind and solar generation, combined heat and power) and flexible loads (storage, computing, EV, HVAC) make it imperative to increase investment and improve operational efficiency. Commercial and residential buildings, being the largest energy consumption group among flexible loads in microgrids, have the largest potential and flexibility to provide demand-side management. Recent advances in networked systems and the anticipated breakthroughs of the Internet of Things will enable significant advances in demand-response capabilities of intelligent load networks of power-consuming devices such as HVAC components, water heaters, EV charging stations, and many more. In this paper, a new operating framework, called packetized direct load control (PDLC), is proposed based on the notion of quantization of energy demand. This control protocol is built on top of two communication protocols that carry either complete or binary information regarding the operation status of appliances. We discuss the optimal demand-side operation for both protocols and analytically derive the performance differences between the protocols. We propose an optimal reservation strategy for traditional and renewable energy for the PDLC in both day-ahead and real-time markets. At the end of the paper, we discuss the fundamental tradeoff between achieving controllability and endowing consumer choice and flexibility. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this regard, analyzing the behavior of electrochemical storage devices such as lead-acid batteries installed on hybrid energy systems and microgrids in terms of their lifetime and economic profitability is an important research topic. Since renewable generation is characterized by its random nature, lead-acid batteries typically work under stress conditions, which directly influence their lifetime in a negative way by increasing the net present cost. Due to the fast growing of renewable sources as a consequence of governmental policies and incentives, the number of manufacturers to be considered worldwide is becoming really high, so that optimization techniques such as genetic algorithms (GAs) are frequently used in order to consider the performance of a high number of manufacturers of wind turbines, photovoltaic panels and lead-acid batteries subject to the environmental conditions of the location under analysis to determine a cost-effective design. In this paper, GA method combined with weighted Ah ageing model is improved by including expert experiences by means of stress factors and the categorization of operating conditions, as a new contribution to earlier studies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by analyzing a hybrid energy system to be installed in Zaragoza, Spain, resulting in a near-optimal design in a reduced computational time compared to the enumerative optimization method. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Accordingly, this paper presents a new multi-objective generation management model for optimal day-ahead operational planning of medium voltage microgrids. The proposed model optimizes both pollutant emission and operating cost of a microgrid by using multi-objective optimization. Besides, a seamlessness-selective algorithm is integrated into the model, which can be adopted to achieve the desired self-sufficiency level for microgrids along a specified planning horizon. Furthermore, the model is characterized by a reserve-assessment strategy developed to handle the load and renewable energy resources estimation errors. The introduced model is solved using a combination of numerical and evolutionary methods of species-based quantum particle swarm optimization to find the optimal scheduling scheme and minos-based optimal power flow to optimize the operating cost and emission. In addition, the suggested solution approach also incorporates an efficient mechanism for considering energy storage systems and coding the candidate solutions in the evolutionary algorithm. The proposed model is implemented on a test microgrid and is investigated through simulations to study the different aspects of the problem. The results show significant improvements and benefits which are obtained by applying the proposed intelligent management. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Also Extracted Oxygen from Power to Gas is an independent product which can be sold separately. The thermal power plant in this Microgrid is a combined cycle turbo generator as CHP source which produces heat for domestic and industrial uses. This Microgrid by using renewable sources, including wind turbines, Solar Panels, Bio-Gas Plant and Power to Gas system is completely efficient, Reliable and more stable. Equations of each subcomponent of this Microgrid will be derived and optimizing procedure with their constraints will cause the best performance and functionality. The operation optimization of microgrids consisting of renewable sources, Power-to-Gas (PtG) system, biogas plant and CHP (combined heat and power) unit was examined. The algorithm was used as a solution for a multi-objective problem to minimize the generation cost and to maximize financial profits. A set of critical operation parameters can be found in real time for different operating conditions, i.e., weather conditions, load profiles, etc. The method was used for the electrical and grid-connected microgrid consisting of renewable resources, biogas, PtG and CHP unit with a total generation capacity of 850 kwh. Simulation studies were performed using the intended island for two typical cases: abundance and a shortage of renewable resources. Results showed that the proposed method can help the system to reduce the generation cost while maintaining the PtG system and biogas plant healthy working conditions. PtG and biogas together will lead to energy cost reduction by producing hydrogen and methane, respectively. This new storage technology and its combination with biogas plant will create a new microgrid model as an environment friendly backup energy resource. The method can be extended to microgrids with other energy storage and distributed generation technologies.},

	abstract = {In this tutorial we describe a list of analytical methods from optimization, control theory, and machine learning that can be used for infusing autonomy in large-scale interconnected networks of microgrids with as little human intervention in their control loops as possible. The cornerstone medium for promoting this autonomy is smart transformers made out of solid-state technology, which serve the dual role of a power-electronic transformer with very fast switching capability, and, hence, with significantly smaller size than conventional magnetic transformers, as well as of a powerful computer or logic-machine that can make intelligent decisions via communication. Solid-state transformers (SSTs) are, in fact, being anticipated to be the backbone of tomorrow's modern distribution grid. Microgrids typically have three layers of controllers - namely, primary control (for switching and circuit-breaking decisions), secondary control (for voltage and frequency regulation, and synchronization), and tertiary control (where a centralized supervisory controller communicates with energy management centers for updating setpoints according to load demands, and other changes in the circuit). Operating these control layers in today's microgrids require professional knowledge of the system, and calls for the operators to manually configure each of the components. With technology advancing to low-cost microprocessor driven devices such as SSTs, we propose a suite of new control and learning approaches that exploit different 'Internet of things' functionalities embedded inside the SSTs, and thereby guarantee at-scale resilience, reliability, fault-tolerance, and autonomy for tomorrow's distribution networks. © 2017 IEEE.},

The recently introduced proportional resonant (PR) controllers have the ability to precisely track AC quantities and are increasingly used in grid supporting inverters, especially for current control loops which are at the heart of power transfers. In this paper, the PR-controller action is analyzed and an enhancement is proposed. It is shown that the classical implementation is particularly sensitive to high frequency noises coming from measurements and relocating the proportional action (RPA) on the feedback path can overcome this issue. The proposed improvement was evaluated using bit-true simulations in the Matlab/Simulink® environment. Obtained results show good noise and overshoot suppression using the proposed PR-controller with RPA. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Optimal microgrid design is a challenging problem, especially for multi-energy microgrids with electricity, heating, and cooling loads as well as sources, and multiple energy carriers. To address this problem, this paper presents an optimization model formulated as a mixed-integer linear program, which determines the optimal technology portfolio, the optimal technology placement, and the associated optimal dispatch, in a microgrid with multiple energy types. The developed model uses a multi-node modeling approach (as opposed to an aggregate single-node approach) that includes electrical power flow and heat flow equations, and hence, offers the ability to perform optimal siting considering physical and operational constraints of electrical and heating/cooling networks. The new model is founded on the existing optimization model DER-CAM, a state-of-the-art decision support tool for microgrid planning and design. The results of a case study that compares single-node vs. multi-node optimal design for an example microgrid show the importance of multi-node modeling. It has been shown that single-node approaches are not only incapable of optimal DER placement, but may also result in sub-optimal DER portfolio, as well as underestimation of investment costs. © 2016},

	abstract = {A microgrid is characterized by the integration of distributed energy resources and controllable loads in a power distribution network. Such integration introduces new, unique challenges to microgrid management that have never been exposed to traditional power systems. To accommodate these challenges, it is necessary to redesign a conventional Energy Management System (EMS) so that it can cope with intrinsic characteristics of microgrids. While many projects have shown excellent research outcomes, they have either tackled portions of the characteristics or validated their EMSs only via simulations. This paper proposes a Microgrid Platform (MP), an advanced EMS for efficient microgrid operations. We design the MP by taking into consideration (i) all the functional requirements of a microgrid EMS (i.e., optimization, forecast, human-machine interface, and data analysis) and (ii) engineering challenges (i.e., interoperability, extensibility, and flexibility). Moreover, a prototype system is developed and deployed in two smart grid testbeds: UCLA Smart Grid Energy Research Center and Korea Institute of Energy Research. We then conduct experiments to verify the feasibility of the MP design in real-world settings. Our testbeds and experiments demonstrate that the MP is able to communicate with various energy devices and to perform an energy management task efficiently.. © 2016 by the authors.},

In collaboration with a local technology provider, we conduct a techno-economic comparison of three different models of distributed solar power in rural India. We compare a centralized charging station with two solar microgrids, one based on prepaid electricity purchases and the other on a fixed monthly fee. Customers report higher levels of satisfaction and fewer technical problems with the microgrids, but the capital cost of the microgrids is much higher than that of the centralized charging station. The prepaid system exhibits poor economic performance because the customers spend very little money on electricity. These results suggest that new business models and technological innovations are needed to strike the right balance between customer needs and commercial viability.

	abstract = {A novel stochastic planning framework is proposed to determine the optimal battery energy storage system (BESS) capacity and the year of installation in an isolated microgrid using a new representation of the BESS energy diagram. The BESS enhances microgrid operation via load leveling and reserve provisions in conjunction with the spinning reserve from dispatchable distributed generation (DG) units. A decomposition-based approach is proposed to solve the problem of stochastic planning of BESS under uncertainty. The optimal decisions minimize the net present value (NPV) of total expected costs over a multiyear horizon taking into consideration the optimal BESS operation considering a novel matrix representing BESS energy capacity degradation. The proposed approach is solved in two stages as mixed-integer linear programming problems to ensure the convergence of the stochastic optimization problem. The optimal ratings of the BESS are determined in the first stage, while the optimal installation year is determined in the second stage. The approach ensures utilizing the allocated budget effectively by performing several iterations. Extensive studies considering four types of BESS technologies for deterministic, Monte Carlo Simulations, and stochastic cases are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Daily load shape has an intrinsic correlation with power dispatch and therefore, during the peak demand hours power systems need to operate on their maximum capacity. This paper describes how daily load profile of power systems interacts with power dispatch, driving the supply side to act in accordance with the trend in electricity demand of the consumers. The load curve has a strong dependence with the attitude of the power system customers and other economic services linked with the power system. Peak demand fluctuations may follow a daily, weekly, monthly or annual cycle and thus a distinct power system has its specific daily load curves or different groups of consumers (residential, industrial, commercial etc.) may have similar or individual daily demand curves (John V. Grubbs). Worldwide, traditional power systems are facing gradual shortage of fossil fuel resources, lack of energy efficiency measures and environmental concerns related to CO2 emission. These problems boosted new trends of generating power known as distributed generation [22]. In order to circumvent high fluctuation of electricity demand, different methods can be implemented (energy efficiency, microgrid system, renewable energy technologies etc.). By utilizing microgrids, incorporating renewable and conventional energy sources, electricity can be supplied locally in an economic and environment friendly way [23], reducing the efforts that the main network should do to meet the demand. © 2016 IEEE.},

Then, we present the black start strategy based on the hierarchical control scheme is presented, including the stand-alone operation strategy, and the grid-connected operation strategy. After the selection of the main power supplies, the master MG is determined. When the synchronous connection condition is met, the slave SMGs which execute the stand-alone algorithm connect to the master MG who provides the voltage and frequency support. Meanwhile, the control algorithm transfers to the grid-connected algorithm, with the grid dispatching value set to zero. Finally, experimental results of the MMGs platform in the Clean Energy Technology Laboratory (CETLAB) are presented to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed black start strategy. © 2016 IEEE.},

However, there are a number of technical challenges: lack of standardized equipment, inadequate stability, and versatile control design. In the past, the interest of power electronics community was moving from a single power electronics converter to multiple distributed systems that encompass a number of converters connected in either series/parallel, forming a number of dc busses with different voltage levels. Recently, with the advance of new dc power technologies, several ongoing standards, alliances, and initiatives are bringing the possibility of developing future homes, offices, buildings, campuses, datacenters, ships, satellites, aircrafts, and other electrical power systems to operate totally or dominantly in dc. Research is being carried out in both the system and component levels of modeling, control, and stability of structured dc microgrids. New high-efficiency topologies and protections are also key nontrivial issues when developing practical dc microgrids. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With galloping energy demands and limited energy resources, it is imperative to look for alternate energy resources to fuel vehicles. This will lessen greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In automobile industry, electricity is the clean fuel which will increase the demand for electric vehicles. In tune with reduction of carbon footprint, different technologies are being tried out to lessen gaseous and particulate matter emission. Due to these factors, automobile manufacturers are concentrating on electric vehicles which mainly depend on batteries, fuel cells and modified gasoline engines (either standalone or hybrid). Microgrid has emerged as a new field which can meet the energy demand of sensitive loads as well as the charging demand of electric vehicles with special emphasis on good power quality, reliability and security. Conventional methods of power generation cause high environmental pollution which can be reduce using renewable energy resources. A microgrid thus can contribute to sustainable and environmental friendly alternative with integration of distributed power generation in the renewable sector.

In brief, a smart grid involves the use of sensors, communication, computational ability, and control to enhance the overall functionality of the electric power delivery system [2].

Such an energy market is being developed to ensure grid reliability, health, and economic operation with the emergence of microgrids, distributed renewable generation, Distributed Energy Storage Devices (DESDs), controllable loads, and Energy Cells. The solid-state transformer (SST) presents a new opportunity to regulate power flow from Energy Cells to the grid in real-time. As the proposed Energy Router of the smart grid, the SST will facilitate energy transactions as an intelligent node, providing communication, frequency and power management. In this work, a frequency based real-time energy market is proposed. Here, it is demonstrated that the grid frequency is a real-time price signal (measured by the SST) which can be used to autonomously calculate the real-time energy price for all energy players, reducing the need to establish complicated networks to determine the market clearing price. In addition to providing a real-time price, frequency based pricing increases grid reliability as energy players respond to frequency deviations and provide frequency regulation as an ancillary service. A simulation was designed to respond to the steady-state frequency deviation in five minute intervals. A pricing curve and DESD response curve were designed to identify key parameters and solve for optimal solutions that benefit energy producers and consumers. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {AC/DC hybrid microgrid is a promising architecture that allows for hosting energy resources and modern loads from AC and DC types; and in turn, it reduces the number of conversion stages among other technical and economical benefits. Consequently, power distribution planners started to investigate the possibility of hybridizing the existing AC grids and designing new AC/DC hybrid clusters referred to as microgrids as a step towards the envisioned smart grid with AC/DC technologies and 'plug-and-play' feature. Nevertheless, while being islanded, AC/DC hybrid microgrids bring operational challenges to the system operation such as coordination among the distributed resources in both AC/DC subgrids, control and management of the power transfer through the interlinking converters, droop control of inverter-based distributed energy resources, and accurate power sharing. This paper looks closely at the problem of active and reactive power sharing in islanded droop-based AC/DC hybrid microgrids and proposes a unified power sharing scheme that is able to simultaneously ensure precise power sharing in both AC and DC subgrids. Test results demonstrate the capability of the proposed scheme in achieving exact power sharing not only among the energy resources in proportion to their ratings but also among the interlinking converters. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed and on-site energy generation and distribution systems employing renewable energy sources and energy storage devices (referred to as microgrids) have been proposed as a new design approach to meet our energy needs more reliably and with lower carbon footprint. Management of such a system is a multi-scale decision-making problem encompassing hourly dispatch, daily unit commitment (UC), and yearly sizing for which efficient formulations and solution algorithms are lacking thus far. Its dynamic nature and high uncertainty are additional factors in limiting efficient and reliable operation. In this study, two-stage stochastic programming (2SSP) for day-ahead UC and dispatch decisions is combined with a Markov decision process (MDP) evolving at a daily timescale. The one-day operation model is integrated with the MDP by using the value of a state of commitment and battery at the end of a day to ensure longer term implications of the decisions within the day are considered. In the MDP formulation, capturing daily evolving exogenous information, the value function is recursively approximated with sampled observations estimated from the daily 2SSP model. With this value function capturing all future operating costs, optimal sizing of the wind farm and battery devices is determined based on a surrogate function optimization. Meanwhile, a multi-scale wind model consistent from seasonal to hourly is developed for the connection of the decision hierarchy across the scales. The results of the proposed integrated approach are compared to those of the daily independent 2SSP model through a case study and real wind data. © 2017},

	abstract = {Large-scale compressed air energy storage (CAES) is an effective way to shift electricity from peak periods to off-peak periods, and utilize photovoltaics, wind power and other new energies, fluctuant and intermittent. However, high pressure air storage tank increases construction cost, limiting installed capacity and application scope. Salt cavern air storage technology could meet requirements of air storage of advanced adiabatic CAES for its advantages of low construction cost, small land occupation, technology maturation, fine sealing, high reliability and high safety. In this paper, features of salt cavern air storage technology are presented firstly. And then, working principle and key technological issues of advanced adiabatic CAES with salt cavern air storage are expounded based on Jintan national demonstration project, Jiangsu. Finally, potential application prospects of CAES with salt cavern air storage in future power grids and microgrids are discussed. © 2017, Power System Technology Press. All right reserved.},

	abstract = {Energy plays a major role in global economic landscape. The modernization of energy infrastructure otherwise called Power Grid, with integration of renewable energy sources like Solar, Wind have emerged as a key focus area across the world. The Smart grid vision generally describes a power system that is more intelligent, more decentralized and resilient, more controllable and better protected than todays grid. Integrated Communications becomes one of five key technologies for Smart Grid. In the SmartGrid evolution Microgrid enjoys major significance. Microgrid comprises of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) including Solar, Wind and tidal etc. on one side and a set of loads serviced by this energy generation on the other side. By using Microgrids and integrating renewable sources, we can satisfy the needs of residential, campus or community wide energy needs and since it is intended for local consumption, involves reduced capital. Microgrids being an emerging scenario,significant exploration on the use of new technologies is applied on these systems. In order to satisfy the reach and ability of communication in these networks including rural areas, it becomes a necessity to consider the Internet and Telecom based wireless networks. There are two specific trends in this area which are of interest, which are Internet Of Things (IoT) and Software Defined Networks. The Purpose of this Study is to explore these technologies in the context of Automation Systems considering the use cases from Microgrid Systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the ongoing transformation of national energy structure, there is a growing trend that large-scale microgrid cluster integrates into the existing power system, therefore, not only microgrid adaptability to network configuration and operational constraints are required, but also new interaction mechanisms both among microgrids and between the microgrid cluster and the upper utility grid should be investigated to improve control flexibility as well as overall economy. In terms of large-scale microgrid cluster integration, we proposed a novel solution for microgrid interconnection and interaction. A further endeavor was made upon reviewing and analyzing the associated key techniques and obstacles which have been spotted in current researches both at home and abroad. Moreover, a typical case study of multi-energy microgrid cluster was given. The results indicate that multi-microgrid interconnection not only enhances system stability via mutual supporting and mutual reserve, but also realizes energy implementation at a broader range and improves microgrid flexibility in providing ancillary services, therefore greatly facilitates their participation in various types of electricity markets. © 2015, High Voltage Engineering Editorial Department of CEPRI.

	abstract = {The exploitation of renewable energy resources poses great challenges regarding the manner in which they can be integrated into the modern electrical distribution infrastructure. To understand the difficulties of integration of Distributed Generation (DG) in electricity distribution network, the analyses and result of the effects on aspects of power quality are provided, as can be the problem of failure defects in networks and how DG grid connection affects voltage control at both medium-voltage (MV) and low-voltage (LV) levels. Results demonstrated that there was a communication system between all generators protective systems, a selective protective system, a tracking of perturbations system to isolate failure defects, and a phase control system between the generators and the network. Also synchronizing voltage regulation is crucial for guaranteeing the quality of the power supply. Currently, recent and modern technologies allow different services to share a single communications infrastructure while guaranteeing the required levels of security, reliability, and efficiency. This paper aims to provide a Smart City (SC) project, implemented in the city of Malaga, Spain, where the integration of the applications of Smart Grid (SG) and the Use Cases (UCs) for the different functionalities of SG has been developed. The SC architecture proposed envisions a hierarchical, distributed, and autonomous structure to address the challenge of smart distribution grids. As a result of this project, new levels of standardization of languages and protocols and new interconnection functions will be required. These functions will allow smart devices to recognize each other so that they can reconnect in case of failure regardless of the state of the network topology. In conclusion, renewable energy sources (RES) can be optimally integrated into the distribution grid. Generation can approach consumption through the installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels and mini-wind generators, with the reuse of electrical infrastructure. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Additionally, a pricing strategy for the hour-ahead energy market and an energy-broker system method for clearing the Power Exchange are also presented.

This is a significant shift from purchase of a simple, fixed technological product to partnership with a service provider employing a flexible array of technologies that exploit a broad range of opportunities that will continue to change rapidly over a long period. The US military is currently leading the conversion to microgrids. Policy levers have been applied to make microgrids a success, including new contracting mechanisms, modified rules, ample funding, and political support. Everything appears to be in place, except that the underlying managerial culture is poorly matched to the opportunity. Habitual management and procurement practices have become an impediment, and policy levers have left this culture untouched. These practices grew from experience with the purchase of commodities and long-term fixed assets. While these practices continue to be workable in many situations, they tend to suppress complex, systemic, evolutionary programs for energy and resource management. Alternative practices are proposed that are more likely to bring out the full potential of microgrids. © Global Institute of Flexible Systems Management 2013.},

	abstract = {The smart grid, regarded as the next generation of power grid, uses two-way flows of electricity and information to create a widely distributed automated resilient energy delivery network. The smart grid will meet environmental targets to accommodate a greater emphasis on demand response, and to support plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) as well as distributed generation and storage capabilities. The PEVs including all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) will play a significant role in the electric power system. The connection of PEVs can have serious impact on the future smart grid. Although PEVs can provide a new opportunity to reduce oil consumption by drawing on power from the electric power grid, they can be used as energy storage to provide the energy into power grid. The power flow between PEVs and the grid can be bidirectional if PEVs have the function of vehicle-to-grid (V2G), which can be either as flexible loads (charging mode) or storage sources (discharging mode). To maximize the benefits of V2G, the emerging PEV infrastructure must provide access to electricity from the smart grid, satisfy driver expectations, and ensure safety. This chapter introduces a basic concept of the smart grid and its "building blocks,"microgrids, and impact of PEVs on distributed energy resources in the smart grid and V2G technology and PEVs charging infrastructures. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.},

	abstract = {Recently, the smart grid is expected to modernize the current electricity grid by commencing a new set of technologies and services that make the electricity networks secure, automated controlled, cooperative and sustainable. Consequently, the smart control centre feels the requirement of a robust and scalable technique for state estimation (SE) that allows continuous and accurate wide-area real-time monitoring of power system operation and customer utilization of smart grid. This paper proposes a Kalman filter (KF) based micro grid SE using the internet of things (IoT) communication network under two different sensing scenarios. Particularly, the observation from the multiple distributed energy resources (DERs) information is obtained by a set of sensors, which is transmitted to a control center via the IoT communication network. In this control center, the information is fed to a state estimator program for estimating the states of the multiple DERs. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed KF based micro grid SE is able to estimate the system states properly in all scenarios. Results indicate that it is better to use the same number of sensors as that of states for properly estimating the DERs states using the IoT communication network. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a very vast area and has villages which are very far from the national power grid. Although Saudi Arabia has very high energy potentials from renewable energy resources such as solar and wind energy, diesel generators are still used to supply power for remote villages. However, the concept of an islanded micro grid (MG) is a new method of generating power which involves integrating renewable energy sources with appropriate energy storage technologies to supply power to an area. Optimizing the size of hybrid micro sources for an islanded MG with minimum capital and operational cost while achieving the targeted availability of power supply, is a challenging task. In this paper, typical meteorological data is analyzed using the forever power method. Many combinations of PV panels and wind turbines are generated with their all corresponding availabilities. The goal of this study is to allow the designer to select the size that best fits the targeted availability, cost, environmental benefit, and reliability. This method is applied to an islanded MG for four houses at a rural area near Yanbu City, Saudi Arabia. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Smart Grid concept has been conceived as the integration of the electrical grid (generation, transmission and distribution) and the communications network of an electric utility. Although, traditional communications interfaces, protocols and standards has been used in the electrical grid in an isolated manner, modern communications networks are considered as the fundamental enabling technologies within a Smart Grid environment. Emerging communications technologies, protocol architectures and standards can help to build a common communications network infrastructure for data transport between customer premises, power substations, power distribution systems, utility control centers and utility data centers. The Smart Grid will support traditional applications such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), distribution automation (DA), energy management systems (EMS), demand site management (DSM) and automated meter reading (AMR), etc., as well as new applications like advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), substation automation (SA), microgrids, distributed generation (DG), grid monitoring and control, data storage and analysis, among others. To make this possible, the Smart Grid requires a two-way wide area communications network between different dispersed areas, from generation to consumer premises. An AMI system uses communication technologies for smart meter reading several times a day to get data consumption of electricity, as well as sending outage alarm information and meter tampering almost in real time, from the meter to the control center. Currently, there are various communication technologies to implement AMI systems. This paper presents an overview of the most relevant communications technologies that can be used to implement AMI communications infrastructure such as neighborhood area networks (NAN), field area networks (FAN) and wide area networks (WAN) using different transmission media such as fiber optics, spread spectrum radio frequency, microwave, WiMAX, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, cellular, and power line carrier. In addition, a review of the current state of progress in the implementation of various AMI projects around the world and the desired state for projects completion by the year 2020 is also presented. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Thermal energy storage (TES) and distributed generation technologies, such as combined heat and power (CHP) or photovoltaics (PV), can be used to reduce energy costs and decrease CO2 emissions from buildings by shifting energy consumption to times with less emissions and/or lower energy prices. To determine the feasibility of investing in TES in combination with other distributed energy resources (DER), mixed integer linear programming (MILP) can be used. Such a MILP model is the well-established Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM); however, it currently uses only a simplified TES model to guarantee linearity and short run-times. Loss calculations are based only on the energy contained in the storage. This paper presents a new DER-CAM TES model that allows improved tracking of losses based on ambient and storage temperatures, and compares results with the previous version. A multi-layer TES model is introduced that retains linearity and avoids creating an endogenous optimization problem. The improved model increases the accuracy of the estimated storage losses and enables use of heat pumps for low temperature storage charging. Results indicate that the previous model overestimates the attractiveness of TES investments for cases without possibility to invest in heat pumps and underestimates it for some locations when heat pumps are allowed. Despite a variation in optimal technology selection between the two models, the objective function value stays quite stable, illustrating the complexity of optimal DER sizing problems in buildings and microgrids. © 2014.},

The practical optimal allocation problems have non-smooth cost functions with equality and inequality constraints that make the problem of finding the global optimum difficult using any mathematical approaches. A dynamic capacity adjustment algorithm is incorporated in the matrix real-coded genetic algorithm (MRCGA) framework to deal with the non-smooth cost functions. The proposed cost function takes into consideration operation cost minimisation as well as investment cost minimisation at the same time for the MG. Moreover, an energy storage equality constraint is applied to manage the state of charge of EES in MGs. The MRCGA is used to minimise the cost function of the system while constraining it to meet the customer demand and security of the system. For each studied case, sets of optimal capacities and economic operation strategies of ESS and DG sources are determined. The computational simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2014.},

	abstract = {The grid is widely distributed in China. For the safe and efficient operation of the grid, building of the smart grid is necessary. Only in this way can allocate resources optimally and achieve long range and large scale power transmission. Based on the urgent requirements of the smart grid, spaceborne SAR can take its advantage of all-weather, all-time, high resolution and wide area monitoring to achieve the large area, real-time, accurate early warning and monitoring of grid operation state. The spaceborne SAR technology is an effective way to ensure the safety and reliability of the grid power transmission. Spaceborne SAR technology application in the grid including: (1) Aided power transmission line planning. Spaceborne SAR technology can be used to monitor the landform, surface features and geological condition along the transmission line corridor. With the scientific guidance of the new transmission line planning, spaceborne SAR technology makes the grid more efficient and economical. (2) Transmission tower and transmission line corridor monitoring. Spaceborne high resolution SAR can be used to monitor the deformation of the tower. Using polInSAR technology, the tree height and illegal building under the transmission line can be accurately measured, to ensure the transmission security. (3) Natural disaster warning and assessment. Through monitoring the ground deformation around the tower by D-InSAR technology, give early warning to the possible disaster, such as landslide and debris flow, etc. After a natural disaster (ice-snow disaster, earthquake, flooding, typhoon), the evaluation of the influence to grid devices help decision maker to take actions and guarantee the safety of the grid. Moreover, based on the satellite constellation, the full coverage of the grid will be realizable. This makes full use of the advantage of spaceborne SAR technology, and will accelerate the construction of smart grid. Copyright © 2016 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

In parallel, small-scale storage is being also installed at the LV level by SENSIBLE. For these new grid assets, the SENSIBLE project is implementing a use case for centralized control approach that guarantees a coordinated operation of MV and LV storage.

	abstract = {Decentralized generation (DG) systems are developed nowadays, as one of the possible means of addressing electricity and environmental challenges; they also offer social and economic benefits. DGs are suitable both for stand-alone and grid-tied applications. When operated in stand-alone, they could provide electricity for non-grid connected homes. However, in a grid-tied mode, they could supply power to households which are already connected to the network, providing the users with the opportunity to sell back excess energy to the grid. In this paper, we present the benefits of DG from the residential perspective. Case studies were conducted for two different locations- Nigeria and New Zealand, with dissimilar energy resources and demands. We simulate different off-grid and grid-connected systems, to obtain the energy configurations with the optimal component sizes and costs of energy. The energy technologies examined are solar, wind and diesel generator systems. The simulation results reveal that DGs have the potential to offer clean, cost-effective and reliable energy solutions for household applications. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart Grids (SGs) constitute the evolution of the traditional electrical grid towards a new paradigm, which should increase the reliability, the security and, at the same time, reduce the costs of energy generation, distribution and consumption. Electrical microgrids (MGs) can be considered the first stage of this evolution of the grid, because of the intelligent management techniques that must be applied to assure their correct operation. To accomplish this task, sensors and actuators will be necessary, along with wireless communication technologies to transmit the measured data and the command messages. Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) are therefore a promising solution to achieve an intelligent management of MGs and, by extension, the SG. In this frame, this paper surveys several aspects concerning the application of WSANs to manage MGs and the electrical grid, as well as the communication protocols that could be applied. The main concerns regarding the SG deployment are also presented, including future scenarios where the interoperability of different generation technologies must be assured. © 2016 by the authors.},

In the control, structure, each unit, is independently controlled and the entire system of controllers is connected by a communication network. Compared to the centralized secondary control, scheme, it, makes the MG systems reduce the requirements of communication links bandwidth, toward standardization and. be easy to expand. The proposed approach is not, only able to compensate voltage unbalance at, the Point, of Common Coupling (PCC), but, also ensures reactive power sharing accurate.

	abstract = {With the cost of computation and information distribution continually decreasing, as well as accelerating deployment of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles (EVs), there is an opportunity to create an efficient electricity distribution and electrified transportation network by combining these technologies. This paper describes a technology whereby renewable energy can be seamlessly integrated into a local network keeping the network load constant, but using all the fluctuating energy locally when it is available. This technique is a type of demand side management (DSM)whereby consumption of deferrable electric loads is adjusted in order to provide maximum utility to the electricity network without impacting the end user. Many household loads are already suitable for DSM, and with an increased uptake of EVs, a sizable amount of demand could be controlled in this manner, which could in turn significantly improve the viability of fluctuating energy sources. In this paper a new DSM scheme, termed localized demand control (LDC), has been designed, and its operation and performance is compared with the classical DSM method of dynamic demand control. It is shown that the system dynamics of both controllers are similar, but LDC is intrinsically more stable over a wider range of applications. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {New York State is leading the nation in developing new policies to encourage and reward consumers to use new technologies and control energy usage. In 2013, the NY Public Service Commission commenced its Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) initiative to reform New York State's energy industry and regulatory practices. This initiative is aimed at regulatory changes that promote more efficient use of energy, deeper penetration of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar, wider deployment of distributed energy resources, such as microgrids, on-site power supplies, and storage. Several factors including rising cost of energy, extreme weather events such as Superstorm Sandy that led to prolonged outages and environmental concerns about building more fossil-based energy plants compelled regulators to seek this change in power market design. In December 2014, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), in partnership with the New York Governor's Office of Storm Recovery announced the availability of up to $40,000,000, under the NY Prize Community Grid Competition, to support the development of community microgrids. The purpose of this competition is to solicit proposals to design and build community grids that improve the local electrical distribution system performance and resiliency in both a normal operating configuration as well as during times of electrical grid outages. Communities in NY prize were encouraged to consider the REV principles as they developed plans for a community microgrid. The NY Prize competition is comprised of three (3) stages: Stage 1: Feasibility Assessment Stage 2: Audit-Grade Detailed Engineering Design and Financial/Business Plan Stage 3: Microgrid Build-out and Operation In stage 1 of the competition which commenced at the beginning of 2015, Communities were encouraged to offer proposals for conducting a Feasibility Assessment for a community grid. Community proposals satisfying the specified evaluation criteria will be awarded up to $100,000 in NY Prize funding to conduct a Feasibility Assessment. In Stage 2, Communities awarded funding under the first stage of the NY Prize competition will be encouraged to submit their Feasibility Assessments for Stage 2 consideration. Proposals from this field of competitors will be evaluated against prescribed criteria and some will be awarded under the Stage 2 design competition and receive NY Prize funding of up to $1,000,000 to prepare a detailed, Audit-grade Engineering Design and Financial and Business Plan. In Stage 3 of the competition, all or some of these proposed plans will be awarded NY Prize funding for construction and post-commissioning monitoring and evaluation activities. NYSERDA anticipates up to $25 million in NY Prize funding being available to potentially support the construction of up to 5-7 community grid projects. This paper will summarize the key technical, commercial and financial guidelines that were developed to guide the participants through the various stages of the NY Prize Community Grid Competition. In particular, the guidelines developed for the detailed technical design of the electrical, controls and communication infrastructure of the community grid will be covered in detail. The objective of this paper is to summarize these guidelines for the benefit of other entities that would like to embark on a similar approach for promoting microgrids and community grids. © 2016 CIGRE.

	abstract = {The world of intelligent microgrids and smart grids is rapidly evolving, with new technologies frequently emerging. Integrating "smart" controls into tactical or mobile grids is critical for remote locations that may not have access to utility power. This paper describes research on a process by which a power network topology can be automatically mapped, allowing the control system to identify which equipment is powered by a specific generator. Called the power beacon, this technology is designed to be used in cases where electric subgrids can be joined or split to accommodate power sharing for tactical or emergency power grids. The power beacon operates by issuing a brief current that can be measured at the generation source. Each load in the power grid is retrofitted with the simple and inexpensive circuitry to create this signal. If the grid configuration changes, an iterative process is used so that the location of each load with respect to its power source can be automatically and rapidly determined. Research and development of the power beacon evaluated various methods for generating the current pulses. Initial testing of the concept included shaping of the pulse to reduce noise, as well as testing open and closed loop pulse generation with and without feedback. The development also addressed pulse frequency to help mitigate the negative effect the load inductance will have on power beacon operations. The design process and results from initial testing acted as a proof of concept. Based on the initial results of system testing, modifications were made to handle electrical "noise" coming from the sample power distribution system.

Solid-state transformer (SST) is a new type of power converter that is employed in microgrids to achieve miniaturisation and promising performance. It comprises an isolated DC-DC converter with planar transformer integrated in the high frequency AC stage. In order to study its applications at medium frequency, different converter topologies should be simulated and analysed. In this paper, planar litz wire is compared with solid conductor in the transformer embedded in HF-link isolated DC-DC converters. Its pros and cons are discussed in detail. Small signal equations for a phase-shifted full-bridge (PSFB) DC-DC converter have been also derived with its corresponding controller being designed.

The proposed control strategy uses a new convex formulation of the DC microgrid dynamic optimal power flow problem, based on a static voltage-current model and linear power flow approximations. Unlike optimisation strategies based on a single bus model, line losses and line voltage drops are included in the optimisation. The availability of fast and robust solvers for convex optimisation problems makes this a scalable solution for a real-time model predictive control implementation. To verify the performance of the proposed control strategy, real-time simulations were carried out for a DC microgrid with distributed lead-acid batteries and intermittent photovoltaic generation. The simulations were completed on an RTDS Technologies real-time digital simulator, using switching converter models and non-linear battery models. © 2016 IEEE.},

We present a MAUT-based software tool to provide support for energy cooperatives when deciding about investments in new supply units. The findings of the literature analysis point out that energy cooperatives have economic, ecologic and social goals. Within our software tool we define measures for the fulfilment of the goals including available data. The utility for each goal is calculated and aggregated to an index.

These new concepts are expected to bring about significant economic benefits at the distribution level in the form of network reinforcement deferral and increased reliability levels, among others. In this context, this paper aims at shedding light on the impacts that the use of MGs for post-contingency distribution network management can have on reliability. For this purpose, a reliability assessment tool based on sequential Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS) is presented and used for the evaluation of a real distribution network, while a framework to implement the MG services is also proposed. The results show that reliability improvements for MG users can be remarkable, while external network users and the network operator also perceive benefits. The former experience higher reliability levels, and the latter experience lower network reinforcement needs when connecting additional customers due to the services provided by MGs. © 2015 IEEE.},

Simulations of these microgrids are time critical yet computationally demanding, inherently complex, and dynamic, especially when they are constructed for control purposes. In this paper, we address the design ranking and selection problem in MG simulations from a set of finite alternatives in the presence of stochastic constraints. Each design encapsulates a different level of control of the segregation mechanism within the system, and a performance function measured as a combination of the incurred cost and energy surety. Building on this performance function, optimal computing budget allocation (OCBA) method is used to efficiently allocate simulation replications for selecting the best design with significant accuracy and reasonable computational burden. Computational results on a multi-scale MG testbed have shown that OCBA algorithm outperforms equal and proportional to variance allocation of replications. © 2014 IEEE.},

Benefit maximization in a microgrid is directly related with demand reactiveness and optimal allocation of local energy resources. Because those characteristics can be implemented through an Energy Management System (EMS), knowing the elements that conforms it and how they interact is crucial for the development of microgrids. This paper presents a caracterization of the EMS and some insight about the actual state on this subject.

At this point of time the utilities are looking for the demand side management to provide better services to manage their network. The new generation technologies of energy meters known as smart meters are used for multi-purposes not only to provide energy consumption but also provide information on the usage. All these units are called as the assets of the distribution system. Over the years, Asset Management Systems (AMS) have gained tremendous importance in industrial control system packages. Quantum advancements in technology, device protocols, and application standards are bringing additional value to instruments. Along with advancements, technology refresh problems and lack of unified standards, creating disadvantages for the users. This paper aims at exploring various subsystems and components that become obsolete and need an up gradation in the life cycle of AMS used for designing of smart building networks. Each of these upgrades or technology refreshes of components and/or sub systems individually or together as a system needs to be properly planned to reduce downtime. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of microgrids (MGs) in recent years, it is anticipated that combinations of multiple microgrids-multi-microgrids (MMGs)-will gradually become a new form of power grid. A safe and efficient black start strategy for MMGs is in urgent demand because of their complicated structure and control systems. In this paper, first, we analyze the topology and control system of residential-type MMGs with three-phase/single-phase (TP/SP) architecture. Second, a black start strategy based on a hierarchical control scheme is presented, including the selection strategy for the main power supply and master microgrid, the stand-alone operation strategy, and the grid-connected operation strategy. After the selection of the main power supplies, the master MG is determined. Hereby, all sub-microgrids (SMGs) execute the stand-alone algorithm. When the synchronous connection condition is satisfied, the slave SMGs connect to the master MG who provides the voltage and frequency support. Meanwhile, the control algorithm transfers to the grid-connected algorithm, with the grid dispatching value set to zero. Finally, experimental results from the MMG experimental setup in the Clean Energy Technology Laboratory (CETLAB) are presented to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed black start strategy. © 2016 by the authors.},

Both of these technological innovations enable the design of an AMI with dynamic energy consumption prediction, integrated in broadband telecommunications networks. To predict the energy consumption an algorithm exploits the built-in load profile associated with each appliance in the MG. It was shown that by using an algorithm that queries and processes real-time energy requests at a finer granularity level, the MGs efficiency is improved. Moreover, application of this algorithm in clusters of MGs that share energy and communication resources increases the efficiency and reduces the peak load compared to the use of a single MG by dynamic energy consumption equalization. © 2015 IEEE.},

Wireless technologies such as ZigBee seem to be a good alternative for data transfer within MGs mainly due to low cost, more flexibility and acceptable data transfer rate. In such networks ZigBee-based repeaters are required to strengthen the communication signals if the DG units are scattered over a vast area. This paper mainly discusses on the algorithms required for defining the shortest distance between the DG units and the MG central controller. Different methods are discussed and a new algorithm is presented. Through the numerical analyses, it is demonstrated that the proposed method leads to a high reduction in the number of repeaters than other conventional algorithms. © 2014 ACPE.},

	abstract = {Global humanitarian initiatives such as the IEEE Smart Village programme have been calling for new technologies based on smart village thinking to bridge the urban-rural energy divide and to support off-grid community energization worldwide through micro-utility programmes. Smart village power solutions include energy systems designed to serve the energy needs of small villages and groups of isolated clustered family houses and have the potential for improving livelihoods and sustainability in small rural villages. The African word 'Ubuntu' refers to an old African way of life concept adopted by African societies long before electricity. Applying ubuntu in rural energy projects is not always understood by developers, but it has the potential to shape the current workspace with participatory methods to help reduce barriers of energy entry through old values and wisdom. In this paper we describe a smartgrid control automation solution that supports social ubuntu principles and ways of operating microgrids to help overcome village community energy management challenges. The solution is based on transactive participatory smartgrid control, with self-configured retail pricing signals defined around the needs of isolated off-grid rural villages. It describes new ways of operating prosumer based solar-powered microgrids that aid rural populations in resource constrained parts of the world. A scenario based case study illustrates the benefit of this community energy management system in isolated off-grid applications. The experiment shows that there are promising indications for a reduction in the village energy bill with transactive demand management and load curtailment. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart grids known as future of current power systems enable usage of two way information and power flow. Implementing demand response (DR) programs and integrating electric vehicles with V2G capability in smart grids are not possible without taking advantage of information and communication technologies (ICTs). One of the areas that ICTs can be helpful is primary frequency control (PFC). Frequency control in microgrids (MGs) due to intermittent generation of renewable resources is a challenging task. These renewable resources like wind and solar energies introduce lots of uncertainties in generation. Thus, utilizing new resources of primary reserve and new frequency control strategies in MGs is essential. In this paper, a novel strategy for primary frequency control in MGs is presented. This strategy combines fast ramp rate capability and demand response for improving primary frequency control in MGs. Simulation results in different situations show that the proposed strategy covers renewable generation uncertainties properly. The impacts of using energy stored in batteries of electric vehicles (EVs) in primary frequency control also studied. It is indicated that in high penetration of renewable generation, by using energy of EV batteries, frequency can be controlled in any condition. Therefore, maximum penetration limit of renewables in microgrid increase. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The integration of renewable energy sources and distributed generation (DG) has been causing a dramatic change in the electric power system. Innovative network schemes and operation policies have been proposed to help facing the new challenges mainly based on the exploitation of communication and information technologies to increase the observability and controllability of the distribution system. In this context Microgrids (MGs), which consist of a combination of generation sources, loads and energy storage interfaced through fast acting power electronics and operated as a unique controlled electrical unit, are frequently taken under consideration for network renovation since they can increase reliability and resiliency with less network investments. Typically, a MG is implemented at the LV distribution level and it coordinates the operation of little generation units, like micro gas turbines, micro CHP units, wind and photovoltaic generators. Since the EU long-term goal for the nocarbon society is promoting the development of local MGs owned by private customers, MGs will be important resources for development planning. This clearly requires rethinking the operational/planning methodologies to maximize the benefit of MGs. The planning methodology presented in this paper aims at defining innovative expansion plans for MV distribution systems with MGs. It allows the distribution planner to find the optimal development plan of a given distribution network by assuming the presence of private LV MGs. © 2016 CIGRE. All rights reserved.},

And the configuration and properties of ITLI were also provided as a reference for the application. Analysis of the impact of fault impedance on ITLI was conducted, and the relevant improvement containing low-voltage acceleration and coordinative acceleration were presented. Independent of communication systems, ITLI protection is immune from the control methods of varied distributed generators, and can meet protection requirement in all operational conditions. A microgrid model was established in PSCAD/EMTDC and the ITLI protection has good performance under different fault conditions and high resistance to fault resistor. © 2014 Chin. Soc. for Elec.

This enabling technology incorporates the best characteristics of three modified basic topologies -A DC-DC multi-level boost converter, a DC-DC multi-level buck converter, and an H-bridge -to obtain a seven-level step-up DC-AC hybrid structure using only one DC input and nine power switches for a single-phase output with field-programmable gate array based control. The advantages of the step-up seven-level structure compared to other proposals are higher efficiency, a reduced number of power switches, and high power density associated with transformerless characteristic. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional topologies, the proposed design does not require voltage/current monitoring of the capacitors or a capacitor-balancing control scheme, and only one DC source input is used. Consequently, a high-performance configuration is obtained. The laboratory results demonstrate the validity of the design and the performance of the prototype. © 2014 Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {According to international reports that have also cited in this article, North America covers the 66% of the global electricity that has generated in microgrids. Besides its 2088 MW installed microgrid capacity in 2012, many new microgrids have been installed in North America. The microgrid plants under development, new planned, and proposed will pursue the leading rank of North America all over the world. Therefore, it has intended to analyze the microgrid plants and studies performed in this region to disseminate the findings. This paper presents a review of various North American distributed generation plants together with their tabled test-beds. The microgrid (MG) projects introduced in this study are surveyed according to their generator structures, their integration to the point of common coupling (PCC), and operation structures. The uniqueness of each MG project has shown in comparison to several others. In addition, the emergency and crisis management methods, precautions against overcharge and low generation issues are also introduced for each MG plant. This allows the researcher to visualize today's microgrid and to gain insight into the possible evolvement of future grids. The study concludes by emphasizing significant findings and by suggesting potential research areas that would enhance microgrid facilities.},

A myth is a work of fiction, a story that no one can explain or trace back to a fact. We have seen the myth that microgrids are a threat to utilities grow more common in conversations at conferences, in publications, and on social media. We can make assumptions about how the myth was started. Microgrids are becoming a popular idea, with analysts forecasting billions of dollars in revenue potential over the next five years. Major weather events that knock out service for millions of customers are sparking discussions on the reliability and quality delivered by the electricity utilities. New technologies such as energy storage (ES), fuel cells, renewable generation, and grid automation are making the idea that customers can own, control, and operate their own power system(s) a growing reality. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Smart Grid and associated technical, environmental and socio-economic, and other non-tangible benefits to society, and articulates the need for the concept and the fact that it is a dynamic interactive, real-time infrastructure that responds to the challenges of designing and building the power system of the future, rather than being simply a marketing term. To illustrate the diversity of terminology, the paper compares an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) definition with that suggested by a study group of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Next, a paper sponsored by the Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) that cites three example definitions to highlight the diversity of views of Smart Grid is briefly reviewed. Early misconceptions and characterizations of Smart Grid are discussed as a prelude to addressing challenging issues that motivate developing and implementing related innovative technologies, products and services. The paper then discusses the potential promise of the Smart Grid, which is embedded in its often-cited attributes of efficiency, accommodating, quality focus, enabling and self-healing to name some. The paper then addresses some of the often-cited impediments to accepting Smart Grid which are based on concerns and issues confronting its forward progress, adoption and acceptance. Distribution Automation (DA) and embedded intelligence are discussed emphasising self-healing, optimizing operation and facilitating recreation and recovery from abnormal events. Functional and integration requirements of Distributed Energy Resources (DER,) are detailed. Smart Consumption Infrastructure elements of Distribution Management Systems (DMS,) Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI,) Smart Homes (SH), and Smart Appliances (SA,) are discussed. Following the introductory section, this paper summarizes contributions included in the double issue 42(3-4) of the Electric Power Components and Systems Journal. To begin, papers are offered discussing smart grid activities in China, India, and the development of a Smart Grid roadmap for the US State of Kentucky. The approaches of each of these cases reflect the diversity of policy initiatives in these jurisdictions. Two state of the art reviews are given next. The first considers distribution network active management and future development trends in technologies and methods, where centralized and decentralized management frameworks and applying agent-based coordination are discussed. The second offers a review of smart home technologies and the goals of an energy management system (SHEMS). This section is concluded by a letter providing an overview of recent and expected advances nanotechnology applications in Smart Grid. Following the state of the art review section, ten papers offering new and innovative research approaches and results are included. These papers cover Smart Grid topics such as real-time energy control approach for smart home energy management systems, optimal operation of energy- efficient buildings with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems, energy management and control of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, voltage-frequency control of a voltage source inverter (VSI) in a smart islanded microgrid, smart generation scheduling for wind-thermal-pumped storage systems, optimized power system restoration, robust data transmission upon compressive sensing, data fusion for wide-area oscillation monitoring, satellite based GPS synchronized monitoring systems, stability in Smart Grid with emerging renewable energy techno- logies. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

A Smart- MicroGrid testing facility provides a test-bench environment to develop and analyse new technologies, topologies and control systems for MicroGrid and SmartGrid architectures. These different systems can be analysed with varying levels and types of communication, control, energy storage, distributed generation and mode settings. By testing numerous types of MicroGrid system structures, inferences can be made regarding the optimal design of a Smart-MicroGrid. A MicroGrid testing facility was created as part of the Queensland Government's Peak Demand Energy Management Project. Initial design results for the first set of test systems are presented in the paper. The encouraging results of the initial testing facility design outline the need for such a testing system for future advanced development and implementation of a Smart-MicroGrid. Further expansion of the testing facility with larger energy storage, generation supply and a diversification of loads is the next phase enabling testing of the interconnection methods between MicroGrids. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Smart Energy Grid concept aims to exploit Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) towards making the energy sector more secure, reliable and efficient, while the electricity markets are rapidly becoming more liberalized with new business actors/models being introduced. In particular, passive energy consumers are being transformed into active energy prosumers (i.e. both producers and consumers), while energy aggregation/services companies are emerging as intermediaries in the so called "Internet of Energy" arena. Prosumers need to have their energy assets efficiently managed and participate in the market independently of their size and negotiating power, while aggregators aim at maximizing prosumers' benefits by representing them as a single big power entity in the wholesale energy market. This paper introduces the Virtual MicroGrid (VMG) concept, in which multiple energy prosumers are orchestrated into bigger associations towards optimizing the association's benefits. An innovative decision support system platform is presented showcasing that the management of aggregated energy resources can outperform state-of-the-art solutions that manage resources at the individual prosumer's level. The platform's implementation is based on virtualization techniques and a wide range of functionalities are described, tested and validated. Datasets from 37 real-life prosumers are used and results of various decision-making algorithms show that under different system operation contexts, dynamic formation of prosumers' groups (clusterings) can provide remarkable energy savings and monetary profits to the end users. © 2015 ACM.},

In this paper, a new control scheme is presented for the implementation of electric spring, in conjunction with non-critical building loads like central air conditioning system. This control scheme would be able to provide power factor correction of the system, voltage support, and current balance for the critical loads, such as the building's security system, in addition to the existing characteristics of electric spring of voltage and power stability.

The cyber network is categorized as a digital communication network, so it intrinsically follows similar regulations, as well as faults and failures. A data communication system is a chain of components stretching from a data source to its destination. Like a chain, each component must accomplish its assigned tasks adequately. Nevertheless, this novel technology has introduced new groups of failures that are conceptually different from those of traditional power networks. Power system reliability studies must consider the failure modes and repair strategies of the cyber network. This paper investigates cyber-power network failures and proposes a novel, all-inclusive categorization of failures that have the potential to threaten the power system's proper operation.

	abstract = {Objectives/Scope: Oil and gas process electrification is recognized to reduce operating cost, improve energy efficiency and improve environmental factors. Offshore electrification has been limited by distance costs. Now extended reach for AC systems, improved HVDC systems, and emerging availability of offshore gridded systems that can include multiple power sources and consumers are providing improved economics. Methods, Procedures, Process: The full economic and technical analysis is complex. We will examine how technical factors such as power requirements, distance, losses, and maintenance and operating costs combine with key economic criteria such as capital, operations and energy costs, and depreciation. We will then discuss models for how overall availability and operational stability are affected by the energy mix and the quality of the power management of the microgrid. Other factors such as HSE and environmental impact can also affect the investment decision. Results, Observations, Conclusions: Earlier models we presented, such as those in SPE-162504, considered mainly point to point connections. We here demonstrate how gridded systems, including long distance HVDC connections, combine with local AC grids that can integrate multiple offshore facilities and power sources. The paper is based on experience and ongoing projects in the North Sea and current studies in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea, where integration across multiple facilities and consumers and network dynamics of multiple sources such as Power from Shore, Local Generation and Offshore wind in microgrids have been studied. (We include actual data from concluded studies, or anonymized data subject to client permission.) Novel/Additive Information: The study focuses on large offshore electrification systems that meet energy, stability and economic requirements in large offshore grids. New information includes the effects of changing from point-to-point connections to grids with many nodes, and includes the effect of renewable power on the grid and the effect of battery energy storage/hybridization.

	abstract = {The huge progress of power electronics technology along last decades opens extraordinary new possibilities for the electric grid. Some examples of what can be achieved with the incorporation of electronic power converters in the system are the penetration of RS (renewable sources) and storage, boosting reliability and power quality, and integrating consumers as part of the system. However, there are still some challenges ahead before the massive deployment of Smart Grids. Lately, a lot of research has been carried out on converters topologies and control strategies in order to get the most out of the microgrids. Therefore, there is a need for methodologies that allow designers to foresee the behavior of these systems comprised of several different power converters governed by the proposed control strategies. In this context, this paper studies the performance of the polytopic models for the analysis of commercial power converters working in dc microgrids. This is a nonlinear modeling technique which integrates small-signal models obtained in different operation points by means of suitable weighting functions. Furthermore, the linear local models can be obtained in a blackbox fashion using suitable two-port models as can be the G-parameters models. This work particularly focuses on the analysis of different power converters using the well-known dc bus signaling control strategy. Thus the modeling of the diverse possible states in which this control technique can operate, and more important the transitions among them, are investigated. In addition, the feasibility of applying system level control techniques to the polytopic models of the converters, such as current sharing or voltage restoration, is considered. © 2016 IEEE.},

Traditional state-of-art load modeling methods are not able to reflect the details of the residential loads proficiently. In addition, microgrid load modeling serves as a foundation for emerging smart grid technologies, such as microgrid planning, smart building design and demand-side energy management. In this paper, a Major Energy Consumption (MEC) event based load modeling and identification method was proposed for residential microgrids. First, a MEC event based single house load model was formulated. This was used as the basic unit model for the entire simulation procedure. Next, each event was simulated using multiple parameters with probabilistic patterns in the target residential microgrid. These model parameters were derived via the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. Finally, the case study results of a real residential microgrid was provided to validate the method. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Bob Metcalfe, inventor of the ethernet and wellknown technology visionary, once said, 'Over the past 63 years, we met world needs for cheap and clean information by building the Internet. Over the next 63 years, we will meet world needs for cheap and clean energy by building the Enernet.' The Internet has resulted from revolutionary advances in electronics, telecommunications and information technologies, devices and applications. While it began as an Internet connecting people, by 2008 it connected more things than people. Its exponential growth has been primarily as an Internet of Things. Cisco has predicted that 50 billion new connections will be made in this Internet of Things (IoT) by 2020. The U.S. electric utility grid has until now been a patchwork of monolithic, weakly interconnected, synchronous AC grids powered by a few thousand or so very large power plants that are centrally monitored and controlled. For a variety of reasons this legacy grid approach is proving to be non-viable for the present and the future. It is being supplemented and may ultimately be supplanted by many, smaller networks with literally millions of distributed generation, storage, and energy management nodes. The grid is literally exploding into a network of things. Many consider it to be the largest example of an Internet of Things. The Enernet will be the inevitable convergence of the smart grid with the Internet of Things. Utilities, their customers and non-utility will find it necessary to plan, engineer and operate in the presence of orders of magnitude more devices and systems (e.g., smart nodes on the utility systems and, for consumers, smart thermostats, appliances, PHEVs/EVs, distributed generation / storage, premises monitoring, automation, and EMS, even transactive energy markets)fiultimately leading to billions of new points that require monitoring, analysis and management. Meanwhile, the Internet of Things steadily grows more ubiquitous, powerful, economical and secure. It is an obviously attractive platform for the smart grid or, as Metcalfe has said, the control plane for the smart grid. The purpose of this paper is to discuss why and how the production and utilization of electric energy will become inseparable, even indistinguishable from the Internet of Things. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The energy management system (EMS) at utility control centers collects real-time measurements to monitor current grid conditions. The EMS is also a suite of analytics that synthesizes these measurements to provide the grid operator with information to identify current problems and potential future problems. With evolving grid influences, such as growth of variable renewable generation resources, distributed generation, microgrids, demand response (DR), and customer engagement programs, managing the grid is becoming more challenging. Concurrently, however, there are nascent new technologies and advances in grid management schemes that will improve the ability to manage the future grid operations. These technologies include new subsecond synchrophasor measurements and analytics, advances in high-performance computing, visualization platforms, digital relays, cloud computing, and so on. Advances in grid management schemes include adding more intelligence at the substation and distribution systems, as well as microgrids and wide-area monitoring systems. One key initiative is to develop a predict-and-mitigate paradigm enabling anticipatory vision and timely decisions to mitigate potential problems before they spread to the rest of the grid. The word "proactive" means "to act now in anticipation of future problems." Proactive grid management opportunities and solutions are described in this paper. © 2015 IEEE.},

This paper introduces a new protection scheme based on the initial current traveling wave utilizing an improved mathematical morphology (MM) technology, with simplified polarity detection and new logics introduced for meshed networks and feeders with single-end measurement. The proposed protection scheme provides ultrafast response and can be adapted to varied system operational modes, topologies, fault conditions, and load conditions. Only low-bandwidth communication is required to achieve high-speed operation and adequate discrimination level in meshed networks.

The local controllers insure the stability of the overall ImG while regulating the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of their respective DERs. Each controller is synthesized independently, using only local information on the corresponding DER, its dedicated load, and the corresponding line.

	abstract = {Grid connection capability of distributed generation attracts researchers due to the cumulative demand for electricity and environment pollution concern as a new emerging technology for providing reliable and clean power supply. A microgrid comprises distributed generation, energy storage, loads, and a control system that is capable of operating in grid-tied mode and/or islanded mode. As operation modes are shifted, the microgrid should successfully manage the voltage and frequency adjustment in order to protect the grid and any loads connected to the system. Facilitation of the generation-side and load-side management and the resynchronization process is required. This paper presents an overall description and typical distributed generation technology of a microgrid. It also adds a comprehensive study on energy storage devices, microgrid loads, interfaced distributed energy resources (DER), power electronic interface modules and the interconnection of multiple microgrids. Details of stability, control and communication strategies are also provided in this study. This article describes the existing control techniques of microgrids that are installed all over the world and has tabulated the comparison of various control methods with pros and cons. Moreover, it aids the researcher in envisioning an actual situation using a microgrid today, and provides insight into the possible evolvement of future grids. In conclusion, the study emphasizes the remarkable findings and potential research areas that could enrich future microgrid facilities.},

The microgrid maybe solve the above problem. The traditional droop control technology is common in operation of DGs in Microgrids. But it presents a large frequency deviation when facing large load demand, which need to be solved. A new method is presented to merge the secondary control function into the traditional droop control for multi-inverters. The method can built the relation from frequency unqualified zone by the only primary control to the qualified zone by the secondary control with the help of projection function. The method can automatically find new nominal power output value to change the former operation point to reduce the frequency deviation range and even no deviation without the help of communication. It help the aim of plug and play in microgrids. The test in Matlab/Simulink environments were carried out and the results verified the validity of the new method with secondary control strategy in deal with the large load demand. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Renewable energy sources such as Solar, wind etc. have gained a lot of interest and application in the recent years, as they can provide electric power on a large scale and are environment friendly. The advancement in the technology of these renewable energy systems has been investigated now a days with a lot of interest. An integral component of the power electronics system that interfaces a renewable energy source to the main power grid is the voltage source inverter (VSI). The purpose served by VSI is converting the DC output of the power source to smooth sinusoidal AC for connection to the main grid. A controller also needs to be designed for the VSI to regulate its output voltage and/or output power. Several issues relevant to the control design have been extensively addressed including vulnerability of the system to parameter variation and uncertainty. In this research work we propose, to design a new robust reference tracking controller, its application and, implementation. The robust controller should be designed such that systems performance in presence of uncertainty improves in comparison to the existing control methods. We will develop the robust control law based on the results presented in a recent research work. To achieve reference tracking, the controller will be augmented with an integral controller. Simulation results will be provided at the end to show good reference tracking performance and significant improvement in the performance of the system in the presence of uncertainty. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In most recent years, there is an increasing interest of promoting the proportion of power supply from the renewable energy sources through integrating various forms of small-scale Distributed Generators (DGs) and energy storage units with the capacity ranging from a number of kilowatts to a number of Megawatts, e.g. Fuel cells (FC), Photovoltaic cells (PV), Batteries, micro turbines, to the medium voltage power distribution networks. This is mainly driven by advances in renewable energy technology and the ambition of meeting the target of C02 emissions reduction and the demand of enhancing energy security and quality of supply. Currently the microgrid becomes a new energy provision paradigm to enhance the power supply reliability which has a collection of power loads, micro sources and energy storage systems (ESSs). In addition, the hybrid AC/DC microgrid becomes prevalent which is capable of direct interfacing different forms of renewable sources and loads, and hence eliminates the conventional multiple energy conversions in AC and DC energy systems. Such hybrid microgrid provides a cost-effective energy supply paradigm with significantly reduced operation and maintenance cost. In this paper, we present the modeling and implementation of a simulation test-bed of AC/DC hybrid microgrid system considering the most available distributed generators (e.g. PV, micro turbines), typical storage facilities (e.g. battery) and different forms of power loads (linear and non-linear loads), based on the MATLAB/Simulink tool and investigate the coordinated energy management approach for improving the DG utilization efficiency as well as the power quality under different microgrid operational conditions.

	abstract = {Smart grid (SG) is a new technology which allows the electrical power grid to be smart. Cyber security plays an essential role in the smart grid in order to secure the bidirectional communication between the utility and the consumer side. To pursue confidentiality and integrity, a key management scheme is considered a critical challenge in the SG. As a result, several key management protocols have been proposed in literature. However, many of those proposed protocols have a centralized feature that depends on a single server called Meter Data Management System (MDMS) to distribute keys and update them. In this paper, we propose a distributed key management scheme with authentication capability to avoid the single-point failure problem by removing the need for using an MDMS. Furthermore, we apply our scheme to the microgrid which can be considered a small-scale smart grid and can be isolated from the main grid. The security and performance analysis are conducted to show the effectiveness and scalability of our scheme by considering the communication and computation cost. © 2015 IEEE.},

Wind-Turbine Generators (WTG), Photovoltaic (PV) systems, battery banks and diesel generator are considered in this study. A new optimization problem is formulated for minimizing the capital investment and fuel costs of the system. The proposed model demonstrates that different renewable sources can be used simultaneously for practical applications. A novel algorithm, named GPSO-GM (Guaranteed convergence Particle Swarm Optimization with Gaussian Mutation), for the optimization problem in an autonomous microgrid is proposed. Two operators, mutation and guaranteed convergence, are added to PSO in order to help in finding an optimal solution and to assist in increasing the speed of the proposed algorithm as well as the accuracy of the results. The performance of the proposed strategy is evaluated in two case studies. © 2016, Institute of Integrative Omics and Applied Biotechnology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Combined Heat and Power (CHP) has been proven as a mature technology that can benefit both building owners and utility operators. As the economic and environmental benefits of CHP in urban centers gain recognition, regulations and policies have evolved to encourage their deployment. However, the question remains whether these policies are sufficient in helping to achieve the larger sustainability goals, such as the New York City-specific goal of incorporating 800. MW of distributed generation. In this paper, the current regulatory and policy environment for CHP is discussed. Then, an engineering analysis estimating the potential for CHP in NYC at the individual building and microgrid scale, considered a city block, is performed. This analysis indicates that over 800. MW of individual building CHP systems would qualify for the current incentives but many systems would need to undergo more cumbersome air permitting processes reducing the viable capacity to 360. MW. In addition microgrid CHP systems with multiple owners could contribute to meeting the goal even after considering air permits; however, these systems may incorporate many residential customers. The regulatory framework for microgrids with multiple owners and especially residential customers is particularly uncertain therefore additional policies would be needed to facilitate their development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Firstly, the theories, methods and technologies of comprehensive interaction among generation, transmission, distribution and consumption were introduced. Then a new operation mode of power gird was proposed, through the constructions of transmission interactive platform and distribution interactive platform. The two-way communication network was built to support the platforms to achieve the depth perception, accurate prediction and intelligent decision of each part. Finally, the integrated demonstration project with comprehensive interaction was constructed in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The interactions between each link, including traditional generators, concentrated renewable energy, industrial consumers, transmission network and distribution network, were realized on the transmission interactive platform. The interactions between grid and various loads, such as charging and swapping stations of electric vehicles, smart residential districts, and microgrid, were developed on the distribution interactive platform. The demonstration shows that the proposed interactive operation mode can enhance the consumption ability of renewable energy, can promote the levels of safety, economy and environment of power gird.},

Initially, a summarization of the basic characteristics that define the microgrid concept are defined, leading to the field of new scenarios, such as smart buildings. Next, a description is given about the remarkable contribution that AMI systems can have on the integration of non-polluting alternative energy sources, particularly in the context of microgrids. Finally, some considerations are outlined that may help to promote the incorporation of these concepts at local or regional grid levels. © 2014 IEEE.},

Although the ICT is a major core of the smart grid, the demanded energy for communication purposes is high, and it is critical, especially in emergency conditions where the energy supply is scarce. Many researches around the world are seeking ways to develop greener communications networks, but none has investigated their impact in islanded grids.

It is becoming more common to group dissimilar DGs together to form microgrids, and desirable to allow DGs to be connected or disconnected without detrimental effects upon the stability of the microgrid. This has implications for the design of suitable control systems for operating inverters in a heterogeneous microgrid. Evolutionary computing provides a powerful optimization tool that has the potential to assist in the design of control systems for microgrids. As a first step, we introduce a feasibility study, where evolutionary design is used to optimize control parameters for an islanded microgrid with a large number of inverters. We show that the evolutionary optimization provides improved transient response when compared to a manual design, and propose that this approach is worthy of further investigation. ©2009 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As information technology becomes more widespread, access to real-time data regarding the supply and demand for resources is becoming central to the management of physical infrastructures. Current information systems for resource management are mostly static, so an underlying challenge in the management of resources is how to overcome time-lags in information transfer for efficiently measuring demand and then adequately provisioning a supply of resources to meet that demand. Particularly in the context of 'smart cities', a new framework is required for information management in the context of resource management. In this paper, we propose an information architecture consisting of life-cycle design, scalable and flexible resource microgrids, pervasive sensing, data analytics and visualization, and policy-based autonomous control that directly links real-time demand patterns to the state of various supply-side management systems. This integrated supply-demand information system is used to obtain a more holistic view of information flow through the infrastructure. We show that such an architecture is more efficient at information transfer than existing systems, and posit that this increased efficiency in turn enables improved management of resources within the infrastructure because of the availability of a higher number of degrees of freedom in the management of the infrastructure. The paper concludes by illustrating the applicability of the proposed architecture for a case study of two large-scale infrastructures. © 2010 by ASME.},

	abstract = {The increasing penetration of Distributed Generation systems based on Renewable Energy Sources is introducing new challenges in the current centralized electric grid. Microgrids are one of the most useful and efficient ways to integrate the renewable energy technologies. As the stability of a microgrid is highly sensitive, an energy storage system is essential and it must satisfy two criteria: to have a high storage capacity and to be able to supply fast power variations. In order to satisfy these two constraints, this paper proposes the association of a Vanadium Redox Battery (VRB) and Supercapacitor (SC) bank in a Hybrid Energy Storage System (HESS). A Three-level Neutral Point Clamped (3LNPC) Inverter is used as a unique interface between the HESS and the microgrid. The paper focuses on the dynamic modelling and validation of the HESS, the power division and the modulation strategies used with the 3LNPC to mitigate the neutral point voltage unbalance effect. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart microgrids represent a new arena where several branches of information technology are merging together to allow full exploitation of distributed generation (DG), reduced power consumption from the mains, better power quality and higher distribution efficiency. This is possible because every DG unit includes a power processor (power electronics converter), which allows full bidirectional control of the active and reactive power exchanged with the grid. This capability, combined with a pervasive application of distributed control and communication technologies, has the potential to completely revolutionize the electrical power delivery. In low-voltage residential microgrids, in particular, the availability of intelligent power meters and ubiquitous communication capability will make possible the cooperative operation of distributed power processors and the sharing of any available energy resources, in a fashion that resembles the Internet paradigm. This paper presents a plug & play control approach, suitable for the DG units of low-voltage residential microgrids, which allows effective utilization of the distributed energy resources, and efficient power delivery to the loads, by taking advantage of state-of-art powerline communication technologies. © 2011 IEEE.},

In this study, the potential contribution to electricity supply to a remote community based on emerging technologies for embedded solar and wind renewable energy, is investigated using simulation modelling. The technologies focus on photovoltaic "slate" roof coverings and micro-vertical-axis wind-turbines. A new model for photovoltaic energy-supply is developed and combined with an existing method for modelling wind-turbine energy. These supply-side models are matched to an existing model of domestic electricity-demand for a whole village community. Results show that in excess of 40% of annual electricity-demand can be relied upon from these sources, provided that a mechanism for surplus power export is available. In the absence of surplus power management, however, only 8% of the annual electricity demand could be met by these sources. © 2007.},

	abstract = {Smart microgrids offer a new application domain for power electronics. In fact, every distributed energy resource includes an electronic power processor (EPP) to control the power exchange with the grid. If such distributed EPPs perform cooperatively, all the available energy sources and energy storage units can be fully exploited, resulting in reduced power consumption from the utility, high power quality, and increased hosting capability by the utility. This paper shows that, even in low-voltage meshed microgrids, where the electrical distribution pattern is complex and sources and loads may vary during daytime, such cooperative operation can be achieved by a proper selection of the local control algorithms and by allowing narrow-band communication capability among neighbor EPPs. In particular, this paper describes a token ring control approach which allows full exploitation of the microgrid capabilities with marginal investment in the information and communication technology infrastructure. © 2012 IEEE.},

In the case that multiple distributed resources are connected to a power system, the influence of such connection on power quality and supply reliability is a cause of much concern. Accordingly, it is hoped that new power-supply systems that combine implementation expansion of distributd resources and stable operation of power systems will be established. Hitachi is continuing technical development that will contribute to realizing next-generation power-supply systems aimed at achieving coexistence of power systems and distributed resources. Aiming at power systems, in collaboration with the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI), we are grappling with development of a supervision and control system for power-distribution systems, and we have developed such a system for use in demonstrative project of New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). Furthermore, as for "microgrids" - which are drawing much attention as an implemented form of distributed resources - we are developing a system with functions such as operation scheduling, demand and supply control, and power-quality monitoring. In addition, a request was received from NTT FACILITIES INC. for such a system, so a system for use at NEDO's demonstrative project was developed and constructed.},

	abstract = {The droop control method is usually selected when several distributed generators (DGs) are connected in parallel forming an islanded microgrid. This is because of the advantages it offers such as flexibility, absence of critical communications etc. Besides, several studies add a fictitious impedance to improve the performance of the original droop method. However, only a few studies deal with the design of this fictitious impedance, which is necessary to ensure an improvement in the dynamics and stability of the microgrid. In addition, these studies do not consider load variations for the design of the fictitious impedance, which is a habitual event in these systems. On the other hand, some studies propose a restoration control to bring the frequency and voltage amplitude of the microgrid to their nominal values. However, these do not deal with the design of the dynamics of this control to maintain a good transient and to ensure the stable performance of the microgrid. This study proposes the design of a fictitious impedance that ensures the stable operation of an experimental microgrid without power oscillations during load jumps and throughout its entire load range. This study also proposes a new restoration control that allows to take into account the possible inertias, delays etc. of the DGs and reduces the bandwidth of the required communications. Moreover, the proposed restoration control is properly designed to guarantee a good transient and the satisfactory performance of the microgrid. Experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed controls. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.},

This work presents the results of economic dispatch applied to MGs operating as an island and connected to the grid. The optimization algorithm was developed and implemented in Matlab®.

This work proposes a change of variables for the power electronic converter models from traditional voltage and currents to input conductance and stored energy. From this change of state, a universal point of load converter model can be utilized in the network nodal equations irrespective of the topology of the converter. The only impact the original converter topology has on the new model is the bounds on the control and state variables, and the mapping back to the switching or duty cycle controls. The proposed approach greatly simplifies the modeling of local area power networks and microgrids. This simpler model can be used to study stability, energy utilization, and develop high level control strategies that were not previously feasible. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The DOE's vision of the future electric power infrastructure, GRID 2030, identifies microgrids as one of three major technical cornerstones for a more reliable and congestion-free energy delivery system, and describes distributed intelligence and clean power as key technologies needing development[1]. Microgrids are envisioned as local power networks that utilize DER and manage the local energy supply and demand. The DERs are relatively small in size, and consequently, there is a trend towards their integration at the distribution level. As such, microgrids increase the viability of DER in the distribution grid by aggregating these resources into clusters that have better grid stability properties than a collection of standalone generators. While microgrids would typically operate connected to the national bulk power transmission and distribution system, they would have the ability to disconnect from the grid and function in "island mode" when necessary. This would increase customer reliability by reducing their susceptibility to grid disturbances, while offering desirable security features. In the long term, a move towards a more decentralized power infrastructure has the potential to guarantee a more resilient and survivable grid where faults and/or infrastructure damage remain localized. Historically, a distribution network consisted passive loads dispersed along radial feeders originating from a substation with one or more connections to the bulk electricity system. A typical feeder would have reclosers or sectionalizers spaced down its length with manually operated tie switches to other feeders. Automatic control was limited to basic reclosing operations. SCADA control and monitoring was minimal. Communications, if available, was limited to low bandwidth radio or dial-up circuits. Local distributed generation was virtually nonexistent. A microgrid is essentially a distribution network wherein local distributed energy resources (DERs) are utilized to supply some portion of the electric power and/or local heating demands and can be operated in an autonomous mode. Microgrids will often have no pre-existing communications network or control system. Microgrids may not have dedicated operating personnel. A microgrid could be formed from a utility distribution network, an industrial complex, a university campus, or a remote community. Recently, new forms of renewable generation technologies utilizing non-traditional energy sources such as wind, solar, biomass, or waste heat have been developed. As well, energy storage technologies such as electrolyzers and hydrogen generators (e.g., fuel cells) have emerged and have been coupled to the renewable generation as a way to mitigate renewable intermittency. In addition to renewables, conventional (dispatchable) generation may also be integrated into the distribution system. The resulting evolution in the makeup of the distribution network leads to the concept of a microgrid. Widely recognized technology gaps discourage the use of microgrids. In particular, their low inertia environment is not presently conducive to the interconnection of inverter-based assets typically used by renewable or clean power/energy sources, and existing protection systems are inadequate. Furthermore, the limited generation capacity in these grids, coupled with the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, creates the need for more intelligently coordinated operation of generation and loads to ensure a more stable and effective use of the available energy. Finally, controls and protection to allow more autonomous separation and re-integration with the bulk grid have been developed, but need to receive regulatory and end user acceptance and be fielded and commercialized more rapidly.},

	abstract = {This paper seeks to further proposals previously submitted for a balanced Distributed Generation strategy through modified microgrids as part of the various regional energy programs underway in Africa. This paper also points to R&D advancements in various technologies focused on energy sustainability. Our evaluation suggests that many of these technologies integrated even at microgrid powered levels can provide an efficiency of service beyond rural communities to include large urban centers. This paper will attempt to show that these integrated systems can serve as the drivers for efficient municipal town planning systems, resource management and growth catalysts. Advanced Refrigeration systems using low grade heat as well as advanced technologies such as plasma gasification through a miniaturization process have shown can be supported by small DG systems. The advantages for municipal solid waste management, fuel production conversion from any carbon based feedstock and ecological remediation help establish new paradigms for conservation, municipal planning and development particularly in emerging economies. Several models based on previous publications around the development of modified micro grids are discussed to illustrate possibilities. This development will serve as primary building blocks for future system expansion.

This new structure of MG includes four types of microsources (MS) connected to Low Voltage (LV) side of Distribution System (DS) and a synchronous generator Distributed generation. Due to the nonlinear and stochastic behavior of the system, a fuzzy-neural-network control strategy is applied. By this method, there is no need of storage device and controllable loads which are not economical in distribution networks. LV-side of MG with synchronous DG meets loads and generation rapidly. The proposed MG architecture is more practical due to the presence of various DGs in Distribution network. Regarding the elimination of some equipment like storage device and controllable loads, this model of MG is more economical and practical. As a result, stability in different modes (Parallel, Transient, and Autonomous modes) is improved. Results show that the proposed architecture with the intelligent controller solve stability problem of MicroGrids with good consideration to other issues related to MicroGrid such as economics, protection, Reliability, and so on. The most important point is that in this architecture, the synchronous DG is not added to stabilize MicroGrid, but this architecture is proposed because of its practical issues. The most important benefit of this research is that any DG unit which can provide power with the frequency of 50 Hz would be able to connect directly to DS.},

	abstract = {The electric power grid is evolving from a centrally controlled grid with only a handful of regulated monopolies to an open, liberalised electricity market. In addition, more and more small-scale dispersed generators are deployed in distribution nets. This puts extra stress on the power grid, in an era when electricity is one of the most important commodities for economic, industrial and everyday activities. Therefore, new control strategies are proposed to maintain the desired degree of availability. This paper proposes a general multi-agent approach to cope with these changes, and presents a scheme for distributed control of dispersed generators in a low-voltage distribution net. Based on a thorough investigation of this scheme, we underline the importance of understanding the interdependencies between the power grid and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure controlling it, which may introduce new or amplify existing vulnerabilities. Some mitigation strategies are presented to avoid or deal with these vulnerabilities. Copyright © 2008 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {The power system is a complex entity comprising of a large number of components such as loads, generators, and the control and comunication backbones, which are scattered around vast geographical regions. This complex system is challenging to control due to several factors, including multitude of components, the multiple objectives the control system needs to achieve, and the large number of inputs and outputs of the system. The modern approach to deal with such challenges in the control of the power system is turning the power system into a Smart Grid, the vision for the future of the power system. As a fairly new concept, there is no universally accepted definition for the smart grid. However, various definitions share a number of elements of which the smart grid will take advantage: (i) information technology, (ii) comunications, and (iii) power electronics. These comon elements reflect in the five key technology areas of the smart grid, which are (i) integration comunications, (ii) advanced components, (iii) advanced control methods, (iv) sensing and measurement, and (v) improved interfaces and decision support systems. The smart grid vision requires the active distribution network hosting a microgrid to remain operational even when the microgrid becomes islanded. The goal of this paper is to develop a secondary voltage controller for maintaining the stable operation of a microgrid, as a subsystem within an active distribution network, subsequent to the islanding process. In this work, the problem of voltage control of distributed energy resource (DER) units of a microgrid is interpreted as an application of the rendezvous problem in the distributed control of autonomous mobile vehicles (with dq-components of the voltage interpreted as equivalent to the xy-coordinates of vehicles). In the rendezvous problem, a potential function is defined for each unit such that it incorporates the voltage regulation goals and encodes the "distance" between the voltages of each unit and the target voltage. The potential functions assume their minima when each unit is at the prescribed distance from the target voltage and other units (in case there are constraints regarding other units). Therefore, the effort to minimize these potential functions corresponds to finding a solution to the rendezvous problem, and hence the microgrid reference points. The proposed method is implemented on a test system, and the system response is evaluated.},

Thus, neighborhoods/cities opt for providing energy from green resources. However, the integration of renewable energies could lead to certain problems such as the destabilization and destruction of the power grids. For this reason, it is essential to build a robust management system and efficient communication between microgrids devices. This paper proposes a new approach based on a dynamic assignment of renewable energy tokens (DARET) algorithm and investigates a non-uniform hierarchical modulation as a data transmission technique over wireless channels. The proposed algorithm allows residential microgrids of a small geographic area to dynamically collaborate and share their individual green energy generation in order to supply their overall loads. The sharing is dynamically updated in short-term by exchanging data, in terms of individual demands and supplies, between the consumers over wireless links. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {High Frequency AC (HFAC) power distribution system concerns the delivery of power at multi-kHz frequency via electric cables. Early work on HFAC has demonstrated the many potential benefits of HFAC systems in terms of flexibility to meet loads at different voltage levels, ease of electrical isolation using compact high frequency transformers, and the prospect of significant savings in component count and system integration. High frequency operation can also improve the dynamic response of the system, and reduces or eliminates acoustic noise. However, despite the many perceived benefits, the uptake of HFAC has been very slow. To date, HFAC power distribution has been confined to some pockets of applications in communications, computer and information technology systems. The ever increasing demand for more power at higher efficiency by our environmentally conscious economies means that electrical power will be delivered, where viable, at higher voltage, higher current and higher frequency. In view of advances in resonant power converter technologies, advanced soft switching (zero-voltage, zero-current) schemes, compounded by recent developments in high frequency cable and magnetic materials technologies, this chapter aims to give a timely appraisal of this very promising means of power distribution. It gives a detailed account of HFAC work in a diverse range of applications, from space to automotive, and from computer systems to microgrids. It also discusses the future prospects of this new power distribution system, and explores the new concept of embedding power and data within new cable architectures. It will also highlight key challenges such as EMI, and key drivers for HFAC to become a viable power distribution means in the future.},

	abstract = {The inductive fault current limiter is less compact and harder to scale to high voltage networks than the resistive one. Nevertheless, its simple construction and mechanical robustness make it attractive in low voltage grids. Thus, it might be an enabling technology for the advent of microgrids, low voltage networks with dispersed generation, controllable loads and energy storage. A new methodology for reverse engineering of inductive fault current limiters based on the independent analysis of iron cores and HTS cylinders is presented in this paper. Their electromagnetic characteristics are used to predict the devices' hysteresis loops and consequently their dynamic behavior. Previous models based on the separate analysis of the limiters' components were already derived, e.g. in transformer like equivalent models. Nevertheless, the assumptions usually made may limit these models' application, as shown in the paper. The proposed methodology obviates these limitations. Results are validated through simulations. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Power electronics are a core enabling technology for local area power networks and microgrids for renewable energy, telecom, data centers, and many other applications. Unfortunately, the modeling, simulation, and control of power electronics in these systems are complicated when using traditional converter models in conjunction with the network nodal equations. This work proposes a change of variables for the power electronic converter models from traditional voltage and currents to input conductance and stored energy. From this change of state, a universal point of load converter model can be utilized in the network nodal equations irrespective of the topology of the converter. The only impact the original converter topology has on the new model is the bounds on the control and state variables, and the mapping back to the switching or duty cycle controls. The proposed approach greatly simplifies the modeling of local area power networks and microgrids. This simpler model can be used to study stability and energy utilization and develop high-level control strategies that were not previously feasible. Copyright © 2012 G. M. Vosters and W.W. Weaver.},

	abstract = {Flywheel energy storage (FES) has attracted new interest for uninterruptable power supply (UPS) applications in a facility microgrid. Due to technological advancements, the FES has become a promising alternative to traditional battery storage technologies. This paper aims at developing a tool to demonstrate the use of FES units for securing critical loads during a utility outage in a microgrid environment. The FES is modeled, simulated and evaluated in the MATLAB/SIMULINK® environment. A data center is used to represent a facility microgrid case study. It illustrates how an FES can help improve the load serving capability and provide a highly reliable ride-through capability for critical loads during a utility disturbance. In comparison with batteries, the application of FES for power security is new on the horizon. This limits the availability of experimental data. The simulation model presented in this paper will enable the analysis of short-term ride-through applications of FES during an islanded operation of a facility microgrid. As a result, it can provide a guideline for facility engineers in a data center or other types of facility microgrids to better design their backup power systems based on FES technology, which can be used in combination with traditional fuel-based generators. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the work carried out in the frame of the Spanish MICROGRID project, aiming the study of interaction between an electrical microgrid and the electrical distribution system taking into account both the isolated and the grid connected modes. The general objective is to foster the development of new products for the electrical grid of the future, considering the technical requirements and interconnection standards. Also regulatory and socioeconomic aspects are considered in the project. The paper shows the main results of the project during the simulation and construction phases. In the simulation phase it has been proved that: the state estimation algorithms used at the transmission network are also applicable at the distribution network; DER (Distributed Energy Resources) integration can contribute to reduce load flow through the lines, under a certain installed power level; an adequate control system would permit DER installations to generate energy above the legally established limits without causing problems to the network. The microgrid construction phase has been developed in the Technology Park of Bizkaia (TPB), placed in the North of Spain, where several partners have their facilities. The main activities, supported by site tests and carried on in this installation are: the monitoring of the microgrid using the standard protocol (IEC 61850 part. 7-420); the assessment of the impact of the microgrid on the transformation centre; the switching between connected and isolated mode; the microgrid power quality and stability improvement; the connection of fuel cell to the grid. The main contribution to the TPB microgrid has been the DER technologies demonstration facility located in LABEIN-TECNALIA's premises. It consists on an installation connected to the low voltage network and integrated by several generation and storage technologies together with programmable loads and grid simulators. The project has been developed during 3 years, June-2004 to June-2007 and has been partially supported by the Spanish Government (Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia), Basque Government and Bizkaia Local Administration. Around ten companies and technological centres have joined the project which has been promoted by the Basque Country Energy Cluster, the Basque Energy Agency, Iberdrola and Tecnalia Technology Corporation.

	abstract = {Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that is, most notably, used in economics as well as in engineering and other disciplines. Game theory attempts to mathematically capture behaviour in strategic situations, in which an individual's success in making choices depends on the choices of others. The microgrid encompasses a portion of an electric power distribution system that is located downstream of the distribution substation, and it includes a variety of DER units and different types of end users of electricity and/or heat. Microgrids promote the use of new technologies, under the general Smart Grids' umbrella, in order to achieve more efficient use of electric energy, better protection, improved control and provide services to the users. For the materialization of the infrastructure needed to implement this model, engineers have nominated technologies like smart agents, distributed computing, smart sensors and others, as well as, a solid and fast communication infrastructure. In this decentralized environment, multiple decision making participants interact, each striving to optimize its own objectives. Thus, a game theoretic approach is attempted to model and analyse the strategic situations arising from the interactions. © Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2011.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an innovative approach for the understanding and control of grid-connected hybrid micro-generation systems (HMS) without energy storage, to supply electricity to a group of homes designated as 'Sustainable block'. The initiative is based on an effort to integrate non-conventional renewable energies (NCRE) through distributed generation (DG) projects intended for remote and rural communities in Chile and South America, where electricity supply is both expensive and often times unreliable. This may be due to equipment malfunction, line faults and/or harsh climatic conditions or other natural phenomena like earthquakes, all of which can undermine the electric power distribution networks. Here a systems thinking (ST) and cybernetics approach is employed which looks at grid-connected microgrids supplying power to local loads as intrinsically dynamic, complex adaptive systems (CAS). Moreover, such systems can be viewed and approached as a complex sociotechnical system, wherein the energy users ought to play a crucial role as 'active loads' within the sustainable block to which the grid-tie microgrid is coupled. Building upon this theoretical framework, a set of coordination and supervisory control strategies for renewable microgrids is presented based on homeostatic control (HC) principles introduced by Schweppe et al. Homeostatic control of power systems. In: Fourth energy monitoring and control system conference. Norfolk, VA: November; 1979. The approach is intended to study and eventually develop new forms of sustainable renewable energy technologies (RETs) for DG of electricity and heat, working in parallel with the grid and offering new choices and benefits to energy users everywhere. A concrete theoretical model is proposed and the algorithms depicting the strategies are explained and compared through simulation analysis. Unlike what is available in the literature on sustainability, and looking at what is missing in regards to HMS as sustainable energy systems (SES), this paper offers an entirely new and significant perspective in terms of design and operation of such systems. First the concepts of sustainability and SES applied to HMS are explored, finding that the large majority of the mainstream analysis reviewed on the subject is focused on socio-economic, environmental, and regulatory issues rather than on the systemic, technical and operational aspects of such systems, as this paper does, and how HC, energy efficiency (EE), and a novel approach to energy supply and consumption equilibrium based on homeostasis can help build more sustainable HMS. Results are presented which confirm the hypotheses underlying the strategies employed and the model predictability, showing that SES are indeed possible and feasible. Discussion and recommendations are also offered stressing the fact that sustainability is essentially a systemic property and operational in nature, rather than explained by exogenous factors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The rapid developing literature on 'smart grids' suggests that these will facilitate 'distributed generation' (DG) preferably from renewable sources. However, the current development of smart (micro)grids with substantial amount of DG ("DisGenMiGrids") suffers from a focus on mere 'technology'. Ongoing problems with deployment of renewable energy have shown that implementation is largely determined by broad social acceptance issues. This smart grid development is very important for further renewables deployment, but again there is a tendency to continue the neglect of social determinants. Most technical studies apply implicit and largely unfounded assumptions about the participation in and contribution of actors to DisGenMiGrid systems. This lack of understanding will have severe consequences: smart grids will not further renewables deployment when there are hardly actors that are willing to become part of them. This review is a first attempt to address the social construction of smart electricity grids. As institutional factors have proved to be the main determinants of acceptance, these will also be crucial for further renewables deployment in micro-grid communities. Elaboration of the institutional character of social acceptance and renewables' innovation calls for an institutional theory approach involving Common Pool Resources management, because these socio-technical systems aim to optimise the exploitation of natural resources. Citizens/consumers and other end-users increasingly have the option to become more self-sufficient by becoming co-producers of electricity. They may optimise the contribution of DG when they cooperate and insert their renewable energy in a cooperative microgrid with mutual delivery. Moreover, the option to include 'distributed storage' capacity (electric vehicles) in these microgrids, enables an increasing share of renewables deployment. However, all these options should be institutionally opened. This requires much self-governance and flexible overall regulation that allows microgrids. The research agenda should focus on how such new systems become institutionally embedded, and how they are socially constructed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {In recent years, electrical power systems have changed their structure by increasing the competition in order to achieve better performance and efficiency in the electricity production, transmission and distribution. One of the most important aspects of the competitive electrical energy market is the operation of independent power producers that can be connected at any system voltage level. This new environment concerns dispersed generation where the customers own their generating units becoming both producers and consumers of electricity. The objective of the paper is to describe an improved and efficient computational methodology that was developed for evaluating the reliability worth of dispersed generation in power distribution networks. The dispersed generating units mainly use renewable energy sources (photovoltaic and wind generating units) and a broad range of advanced technologies, such as fuel cells and microturbines. This methodology is based on a Monte - Carlo sequential simulation approach. The basic features of this methodology include the recognition of the appropriate interruption costs for the different system busbars that may supply various categories of customers and the consideration of the duration of system contingencies that may occur. An increased emphasis is given in the realistic and efficient representation of the real design and operational features and practices applied in the distribution networks such as the modelling of the dispersed generating units and the operation of dispersed generation in parallel with the high-voltage transmission system that is considered to be the normal supply source of the system. The paper also presents the analysis of a typical low voltage network with multiple feeders supplying different categories of customers (industrial, commercial and residential) and assuming alternative system planning schemes. These schemes include different operating conditions of power generating units such as the different penetration levels of the renewable sources. The obtained results are presented and discussed.},

Real time modeling and simulations with hardware in the loop capabilities allows testing the smart grid control algorithms and new equipments. This chapter addresses two aspects of smart grid modeling and simulation. First one relates to the development of wide area monitoring and control (WAMC) test bed including phasor measurements units (PMUs), synchophasor vector processor (SVP), phasor data concentrators (PDC) and real time digital simulator (RTDS). A WAMC system provides improved reliability, security and coordinated control actions to mitigate or prevent large area disturbances. PMU technology is being deployed all over the world by different utilities for wide area measurement and control actions. These units are mainly based on time synchronized measurements of voltages and currents that lead to accurate decisions and faster control actions. RTDS was used to model and simulate power system and PMUs was used to generate measurement data for power system monitoring. Measured data was sent to PDC and SVP for further analysis and control.

	abstract = {In the ongoing European research project MoreMICROGRIDS funded under FP6, new hardware and software solutions for active management of distribution grids with a high penetration of distributed generation (DG) and renewable energy sources (RES) are being further developed and implemented in field experiments. Further, cost-benefit analyses are elaborated in case studies based on the field tests and regional data in different European countries collected by participating utilities. Chapter 1 presents experience gained with developing the Multi Agent Systems (MAS) for real Microgrids in Kythnos (Greece) and Mannheim-Wallstadt (Germany). One of the main principles adopted in the control scheme was the structural organisation of the MAS into local level, coordination level and multi agent level. Both field tests have been continuously developed to host long term testing of new concepts and components for active distribution networks. Kythnos is an islanded system, whereas Mannheim-Wallstadt is a grid connected residential area which will be developed into a microgrid in the future (cf. http://microgrids. power. ece. ntua. gr). Chapter 2 discusses three major aspects of the impact of DG on network operation costs: energy loss costs, device upgrade costs that are caused by overloading and impact of active network management on voltage. As a result, control of reactive power provides additional revenues due to avoided energy losses. Peak load reduction could effectively defer upgrading of distribution devices. For intermittent DG units, reactive power control only makes it possible to increase maximum penetration level further without raising peak loading beyond original value. No direct revenues can be assigned to the operational benefits on voltage control with active network operation; nevertheless as a technical benefit, voltage stays within required limits that could be exceeded in passive operation mode in case of higher DG penetration. Chapter 3 explains manifold effects of DG and active network management which have positive and negative effects on strategic network planning. Thus, it is important that network planning thoroughly analyzes development of DG penetration in electricity grids from a holistic perspective. This includes considering planning of network capacity, load-flow characteristics, network security, short-circuitpower, electrical strength and also a possible redundancy of network assets due to increasing DG.},

	abstract = {In the years ahead, it is expected that installation of microgrids with photovoltaic (PV) power generation are increased while large amounts of renewable energy sources will be installed. Simultaneously new technology is needed to allow a power supply to be provided steadily with fewer fluctuations both in voltage and frequency within a microgrid. With this in mind, an experimental study project was conducted to find solutions to technical challenges. The purpose of the project was to develop a new power supply system which can ensure required power quality with the best use of PV, and to establish technology for the coordinated operation of a microgrid during grid-connected operation and for the steady operation of a microgrid during islanding operation. The System consists of a PV system (total rated capacity is 80kW) and a battery system, and is connected to the major power grid via a high speed circuit breaker (HSCB). Using the said system, experimental study was carried out on the following test items. (1) To avoid an influence of a voltage dip using HSCB Verification tests were conducted on the system designed to maintain power quality by isolating the important loads instantaneously from the power grid and making a mode transition to the islanding operation when a voltage dip occurs in the major power grid. The tests confirmed that power quality during mode transitions was maintained at a level at which the important loads were not affected. (2) To maintain power quality during the islanding operation Verification tests were conducted on the system designed to maintain voltage and frequency of the important loads by controlling battery input/output in accordance with fluctuations in the power of PV systems and in the loads during the islanding operation. There were almost no frequency fluctuation and voltage fluctuations by 1% or so. The results of field tests the target power quality was confirmed to be maintained. This paper describes the experimental study and the results of verification tests, including new technology which enables stable power supply to a microgrid with the use of PV generation system. In addition, useful insights that were gained through investigation of the causes of unexpected system troubles are described.},

	abstract = {As new wind energy assets are installed at an accelerated pace and wind turbine technology continues to mature, permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG) are increasingly being utilized to derive electricity within wind energy conversion systems (WECS). Attractive as renewable sources, unfortunately WECS can introduce electrical instabilities into some power systems due to the intermittent nature of wind. Examples of problematic applications include: islanded or isolated power systems, as well as weak feeders that do not enjoy robust voltage and frequency control. PMSG technology and modern power electronic switch devices offer the opportunity to help overcome this common drawback of WECS applications. In this paper, a load-following mode-of-operation control scheme is presented that facilitates the use of modern PMSG-equipped WECS in applications where generation-to-load matching is desirable. Fundamentals of wind turbine operation are surveyed to support the case for generation control, as well as the development of a PMSG dynamic model and WECS controllers capable of achieving robust load-following capability. Simulation results are given that show the viability of the proposed control system for the PMSG-equipped WECS under real-world wind and load conditions. Finally, the case is made for the need to incorporate load-following controllers into WECS for deployment in future microgrids that require mode-of-operation flexibility depending on varying scenarios.},

	abstract = {With the development of new generation technologies including renewable energy technologies and the clean and efficient use of natural gas, biogas and hydrogen, distributed generations (DGs) are being increasingly considered to be a right way to provide more electrical power, reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency and improve the reliability of power supply. As a result, with the in-depth study on DG technology, the concept of MicroGrid was presented to describe such systems with some micro-scaled DGs connected to low voltage feeders, forming a relative independent small system. By comparison with the conventional power generation, most of new technologies proposed to be used in Microgrids, such as micro gas turbine, fuel cell, photovoltaic system and so on, have to be interfaced with the grid through an inverter stage. Thus, the use of power electronic interfaces will lead to a series of challenges in the design and operation of MicroGrids. As the dynamic performance of a MicroGrid may be different from the conventional grid and has a very important impact on the protection schemes and the system stability, this paper is focused on this topic. First of all, the brief introduction of a MicroGrid is given, including characteristics of MicroGrids and its development potential in China. And then the representation of a typical MicroGrid using PSCAD/EMTDC, including the realization of the control strategies of the MicroGrid and the representation of micro DGs, is presented. Next, the simulation of the dynamic performance of the MicroGrid in different cases is shown and the factors of influencing the dynamic performance of the MicroGrid are analysed.

	abstract = {A lot of work is presently being done on Smart Grids all over the world and a lot is being written and said on this topic. It is sometimes difficult to really understand what the expression "smart grids" actually covers. This may be due to the very large spectrum and the numerous players which are involved. Indeed the different types of players have developed their own vision of the smart grids taking into account their own activities (and interests). Additionally, the geographical dimension further increases the disparities in the different parts of the world. In this context and without pretending to be exhaustive, this paper tries to describe the smart grids in their entirety. In a first part, two definitions are given for the smart grids and the main drivers for their development are briefly described, such as for instance: deregulation, environmental issues and integration of renewable energy sources (RES), development of new technologies, aging power system assets, etc. Then an overview of smart grid initiatives is given in different parts of the world (e.g. Europe, USA, Asia and Pacific area). In the second part of the paper the main constituents of the smart grids are considered and in particular the following aspects are discussed: integration of distributed generation and renewables (that are both parts of the drivers and components of the smart grid), and potential benefits of energy storage systems, contribution of active consumers and intelligent buildings, deployment and use of smart meters and communication infrastructures, evolution towards intelligent distribution networks; microgrids and balancing issues, role and evolution of transmission networks; evolution of the flexibility of the generation park, integration of electric vehicles, regulatory issues.

The use of DC is not limited to telecom Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment. DC is suitable for simple renewable energy and smart grid functions, such as peak shaving. Researches and standards are exploring other benefits of DC in many other areas. We discuss the latest assessment in energy saving by comparing reliability, compactness, and reduction of power material in line with the new e-waste resolution of the International Telecom Union (ITU-T). We also present the on-going work on DC in the European Telecom Standard Institute (ETSI) and ITU-T. With billions of mobile, portable, and nomadic ICT devices including smart phones, tablets, PCs and many accessories all equipped with rechargeable batteries, DC is associated with local electric autonomy and higher energy efficiency. Mobile networks are rapidly being rolled out in emerging countries and all are suitable for using equipment in safety extra-low voltage (SELV) DC in low-power home networks. In developed countries, the electric mix using more renewable energy is also encouraging the use of DC with local autonomy integrated into a high-quality SELV grid for ICT as argued by Greengrid@Home and Emerge Alliance. We discuss some quantifications of these new DC architectures and how the convergence of ICT and energy can facilitate smartgrids and microgrids towards a more decentralized and interactive vision. Particular focus will be on the advantages and disadvantages of DC power feeding incorporating photovoltaic generation patterns in usage for data centres/base stations/office buildings, DC and DC+AC hybrid architecture considering grounding and cabling, efficiency and spacing, and finally compliance with a vast majority of office devices, e.g., portable PCs, ceiling fans, telephones, mobile phones, tablets, and lights, using DC. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.},

	abstract = {Frequency is a key issue for the stable operation of autonomous microgrid (AMG) with a large penetration of intermittent renewable energy resources. The fast development of demand-side response technology provides a new solution for the frequency control of the AMG. In this paper, a novel decentralized demand control strategy (DDC) for family-friendly controllable refrigerators considering customer comfort level is proposed to regulate the frequency of AMG in coordination with the energy storage system (ESS). The refrigerator under DDC responds to the local frequency signals quickly and adjusts its operation cycle dynamically. Meanwhile, a customer participation degree which is proportional to the frequency deviation is introduced to evaluate the customer comforts when responding to the frequency of AMG. Finally, a benchmark low voltage AMG is established as a test system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed DDC strategy. Simulation results show that the DDC strategy can not only improve the frequency control effect of AMG effectively but also guarantee the customer comforts as well as reduce the capacity of ESS. © 2013 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {The increasing use of renewable energy and efficient use of fossil fuels will lead to a major market share of distributed generation systems (DG) in 2020. A study initiated by VDE, the German electrical engineers association, was performed in Germany to analyse technical consequences as well as infrastructure requirements. The complex nature of distributed supply systems requires an integrated look at the supply system considering both generation and consumption. The knowledge of demand characteristics supports the development of distributed energy systems. Aggregation of consumers leads to an optimization of the demand curves and thus of the system. To cover this demand CHP plants are the preferred solution. To design them heat and power governed mode have to be distinguished. The first one considers a surplus of power to be fed to the grid, the second assumes that the production is completely consumed on site. Storage systems can support the effort to balance offer and demand. In this context self-supplied areas are a special form of distributed systems, called microgrids. Being operated independently in case of grid failures they are comparable with conventionally interconnected grids. New IT systems support this by including an energy management system to optimize the operation of DG as well as bidirectional data exchange. In addit ion, information and communication technologies are necessary that these systems are not limited to local situations. As virtual power plants they can be operated border-crossing. An increasing generation from DG will have an impact on the overall network. This concerns not only the short-circuit capacity and the grid losses but also plant and grid protection as well as frequency and voltage control, reactive and shortcircuit power, exchange of power with other supply areas and many other tasks involved. The overall operation of a grid consisting of centralized and decentralized units requires that DG contribute to the system services e. g. providing power reserve. Scenario calculations in the framework of the study show that distributed systems can provide energetic, environmental and cost advantages compared to purely central supply. They result from combined heat and power supply and the use of environmental-friendly energy sources.},

This, coupled with the evolution of deregulation, has set a stage for new types of business in electric power industry. With these backgrounds, small power supply networks, such as microgrids, are attracting much attention in recent years, as being a new technology to coordinate dispersed generators with utility grids. The present paper describes the status of small power supply networks in Japan. First, the transition of regulation in Japan will be outlined. Following this, results from a field test of a small supply network, which is called "Regional Power Grid", will be discussed. Emphasis is placed on the energy management system, which organizes controllable and uncontrollable dispersed generators into a single controlled unit while minimizing operational costs and environmental impacts.

	abstract = {The electric utility industry is gradually undergoing restructuring and the main paradigm shift is the introduction of the principles of competition. With the level of future demand for electricity being unclear, power market players are reluctant to commit to long-term capital investment, with the result that construction of new large-scale power plants and also transmission and distribution infrastructure is typically being avoided. At the same time, power facilities are being upgraded in response to business strategies for bringing a profit in power markets and for keeping supply reliability for customers. Under such circumstances of competitive power markets, practical use of renewable and distributed energy generation offers an attractive alternative for power supply. The advantages include a short construction cycle as the supply can be located near to the demand, being less of a burden to the existing transmission network, and contributing to prevention of global warming through clean combustion using novel energy technologies such as natural gas co-generation, natural gas micro turbines, or fuel cells. Distributed generations using renewable energy resources such as wind and solar energy are also attracting attention. Regarding practical use of renewal energy in Japan, a new set of requirements advents. The first is the development of a set of policies for promoting power generated from renewable energy. The second is to evaluate the influence of distributed generations from renewable energy on the quality and reliability of the electricity. The third is the establishment of the technology requirements for interconnection with the power grid. The fourth is the development of future energy supply networks such as Power parks, Microgrids, and Smart grids. In implementing future energy supply networks utilizing renewable energy, power electronic devices are widely used to interface some forms of renewable energy generations and energy storages to distribution networks, and their use is likely to increase remarkably in the near future. The development of these power electronics is benefiting from the rapid advancements in the capability of power semiconductor switching devices and in the progress being made in the design and control of variable-speed drives for large motors. The most diffused application of power electronic devices is to invert the DC generated from some dispersed energy resources (e.g. photo voltaic fuel cells, micro turbines and battery storages) to existing 50/60 Hz AC. Also, power electronic devices are used to decouple rotating generates from the network and so potentially increase the efficiency of the operation of the prime mover by ensuring that they operate at their most efficient speed for the range of input power. For example, power electronics are used to support variable-speed wind turbines and are also now being proposed for some forms of small hydro-generation and energy storages during transients [1]. In this article, we will discuss the role of power electronics for renewable energy utilizations and the kinds of infrastructure that should be designed and how this should be pursued in order to maintain high reliability and quality for future energy supply networks in the restructured electricity markets. © 2006 IEEE.},

Some of these subsystems operate in continuous mode and others in discrete mode. It is very important develop models of these technologies so that their dynamics can be analyzed in both short and long periods of time. Individual aspects, such as induction generation, are modeled with dynamic phasors technique with good results. This work presents modeling and dynamical analysis of an induction generator, which is excited by a 3-phase inverter, using the dynamic phasors technique. These models are improved here by introducing the effect of electronic converter harmonics in the model and the dynamic analysis and its effect on the calculation of active and reactive powers. The first model considers the fundamental frequency for currents and voltages, with the DC component and second-order harmonic for rotor speed; this allows observation of the oscillating mechanical behaviors in the machine's speed and torque. Later, including the first and kth harmonic introduced by commutations of the inverter, allowing analysis of oscillating dynamics of the system's electrical variables such as voltages and currents. Also, new equations are presented for calculation of active and reactive powers based on dynamic phasors, which permit knowledge of average and main distorting powers. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The microgrid (MG) paradigm is a new concept which is considered as a solution for addressing technical, economical, and environmental issues of modern power systems. The application of MG is the subject of extensive studies and experimental tests. It is recognized that there are a number of technical challenges concerning the operation, monitoring, control, and protection of MGs systems. In this respect, the rapid development of the information and communication technologies (ICTs) has opened the door for feasible and cost-effective solutions allowing more extensive intra- and interutility information exchange, diffusion, and open access to a wide range of real-time information. Consequently, the ICTs could represent a strategic tool in supporting effective MG operation. According to this statement, the paper proposes an advanced framework based on the service-oriented architectures for integrated MG modeling, monitoring, and control. The proposed framework is platform, language, and vendor independent, and thus it is an ideal candidate for an effective integration in existing energy management systems and distribution management systems (EMSs/DMSs). © 2010 IEEE.},

LVDC system is one of the newest technologies in the field of distribution networks. In this paper, economic design of hybrid AC/DC distribution networks are studied for bipolar LVDC system configurations, area with different load densities and different penetrations of distributed generation sources, considering various kinds of loads. Optimal connection configuration of load points and Distributed Generations to the AC and DC substations candidate points is determined by genetic algorithm considering investment, loss and also customer interruption costs. Afterward, final structure of network is designed by branch exchange method.},

	abstract = {In this paper, multiobjective optimization is proposed for evaluating the sustainable synthesis/design and operation of sets of small renewable and non-renewable energy production technologies coupled to power production/transmission/ distribution networks via microgrids. The optimization is conducted over a quasi-stationary twenty four hour, winter period. Partial load behavior of the generators is included by introducing non-linear functions for efficiency, costs and emissions as a function of the electricity generated by each technology. A new index for resiliency is included in the multiobjective optimization model in order to account for the capacity of the power network system to self-recover to a new normal state after experiencing an unanticipated catastrophic event. Since sustainability/resiliency indices are typically not expressed in the same units, fuzzy logic and an explicit set of weighting factor methods are employed to calculate a composite sustainability-resiliency index. Results indicate for the particular problem posed that the inclusion of microgrids into the network leads to a better overall network efficiency, a reduction in life cycle costs, and an improved network resiliency. On the other hand, total life SO2 emissions and network reliability are not improved for this particular case when microgrids are included. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

The power sources in a microgrid must be controlled in coordination with each other in order to meet the operating criteria of the microgrid as a whole. Droop control of power sources is a known solution for distributed and coordinated control of converters to share active and reactive power in a microgrid. In this paper, the droop control method is extended for harmonic and unbalance power along with balanced active and reactive sharing. Each component of power can be dedicated to various power sources in any percentage, which enables operation optimization of the microgrid. An upper layer controller which uses a low speed communication link sets droop parameters of local controllers. This control layer is in charge of real time optimization of micro grid as well as load bus voltage quality improvement. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Distributed generation is emerging as a new technology for supplying the increasing demand for electricity. Microgrids are attracting a great deal of attention since they integrate distributed generation in the main grid reliably and cleanly. When designing the control system of a microgrid, several functions must be considered, such as the management of electrical and thermal energy, load management, synchronisation with the main grid, etc. Both companies and institutions have carried out research into the control of microgrids over recent years and many proposals can be found in the literature. Thus, the design of the control system of a microgrid is a complex task due to its multiple functions and the large number of proposed solutions. This paper presents a complete description of the main features of a microgrid and describes the characteristics of the control systems used. Details are provided of the control tasks involved and of the main types of controls proposed in the literature. In addition, this paper describes the controls used in existing microgrids all over the world and proposes future areas for research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Human development and electrical energy co-exist seamlessly in high Human Development Index (HDI) countries. 11The United Nations Development Programme defines the human development index (HDI) with education, health, and economic indicators. "Co-exist seamlessly" means that it is almost assumed that a building will have access to electricity and that it is reliable. where reliability and availability of electricity is greater than 95%. In numerous low HDI countries,. 22Low HDI countries are defined with human development indexes at or below 0.50. there is 5-50% electric grid availability. These electric grids can have reliability below 50% due to faults and extreme load shedding. Unavailable and unreliable electric grid events are situations disconnected from a centralized grid (if the grid fails then it is off-line). In Africa, renewable energy portfolios include solar, wind, biomass, biogas, small hydroelectric power and recently nuclear energy (MEMD, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009) and are cited to meet the disconnected grid situations. However, Human Power (HP) is a missing portfolio option and, if implemented in countries with average electrical power consumed below 20. W/Capita, would impact human development directly. The technologies include merry-go-round generators in schools, hand crank lighting in hospitals and health clinics during electricity outages and bicycle generators for off-grid businesses. This result is derived from (1) a new energy concept defined as PACE (People-based Activities Caloric Energy), (2) estimations from children's play - energy harvesting as free energy (3) disconnected-grid fuel costs for petrol and diesel generators, and (4) policy empowerment which is based on designing and building microgrids. These designs result from an innovative Physics and Business of Energy (PBE) curriculum, in conjunction with University of Michigan (USA), taught in Uganda at Mountains of the Moon University, Makerere University and St. Joseph's Technical Institute with an association called Uganda Small Scale Industries Association (USSIA). The HP-module is part of a multi-module curriculum for . Empowering Ugandans to Power Uganda. The overall educational and design policies create a key missing gateway to co-designed and locally built microgrids. These policies are applicable in many, if not all, low HDI countries. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The microgrid framework offers a means to capitalize on diverse energy sources in a decentralized way, while reducing the burden on the utility grid by generating power close to the consumer. As a critical component to enabling power system diversity and flexibility, microgrids encompass distributed generators and load centers with the capability of operating islanded from or interconnected to the macrogrid. To make microgrids viable, new and innovative techniques are required for managing microgrid operations given its multi-objective, multi-constraint decision environment. In this article, two example computational intelligence methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and ant colony optimization (ACO), for application to the microgrid power management problem are introduced. A mathematical framework for multi-objective optimization is presented, as well as a discussion of the advantages of intelligent methods over traditional computational techniques for optimization. Finally, a three-generator microgrid with an ACO-based power management algorithm is demonstrated and results are shown. ©2010 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses ultrahigh-voltage (UHV) DC as an efficient solution for bulk power transmission especially of renewable energy. The European policy and legal framework is used to illustrate how this new technology, international electricity market integration, and the distribution of wind and solar natural resources lead to the need for continent-wide internationally coordinated network planning with a view on long-term greenhouse gas reduction. First, the technical and economic aspects of UHV transmission are described, including, e.g., converter configurations and internal and external insulation. Then, UHV transmission is put into the context of other broad current questions of power system development: AC and DC, microgrids, smart grids, power electronics, overhead lines, cables, and gas-insulated lines. The final part discusses the European legal framework for climate protection and for transmission system operator (TSO) cooperation in the new, legally mandated European transmission system operator association ENTSO-E, in particular for joint European grid planning and for R&D. This example shows how UHV technology development can contribute to market integration and economic and environmental goals for continent-wide and internationally coordinated transmission development as one option in international long-term system studies. © 2006 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a model to innovate the engineering curriculum to include sustainability and IT topics in order to develop the skills and competencies the future professionals will need to design, build and manage future cities. Multidisciplinary topics include traditional ecological engineering; life-cycle design; scalable and configurable resource microgrids; pervasive sensing infrastructure, aggregation and dashboards; knowledge discovery, data mining and visualization; and, policy based control and operation. Rather than developing a new program, we propose to develop modules or tracks in what we call - SustainIT - the idea adapted from the successful 2006 US NAE Gordon Prize engineering curriculum innovation, The Learning Factory. This model follows a proven roadmap to reform and complement existing Bachelor's of Science (BS) degrees in engineering. By providing a series of guided electives, any engineering program may offer engineering, and/or computer science students the opportunity to specialize in the area of IT for Sustainability. We also propose two Master's degree tracks - Information Technology for Sustainability and Infrastructure Technology for Sustainability - for engineering and computer science Master's degrees. The intent of proposing this curriculum innovation is to catalyze a discussion among stakeholders that will lead to the development of learning experiences to address the need for engineers that will have the skills and training to collect and analyze future cities data and make intelligent decisions for sustainability.

	abstract = {The Smart Grid concept has been foreseen as the integration of the electrical generation, transmission and distribution network and the data communications network. Although, traditional communications interfaces, protocols and standards has been used in the electrical grid in an isolated manner, modern communications network is considered as the fundamental enabling technology within the future Smart Grid. Modern communications technologies, protocol architectures and standards can help to build a common communications network infrastructure for data transport between customer premises, power substations, power distribution systems, utility control centres and utility data centres. The Smart Grid will support traditional applications such as SCADA, distribution automation (DA), energy management systems (EMS), demand site management (DSM) and automatic meter reading (AMR), etc., as well as new applications like advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), substation automation (SA), microgrids, distributed generation, grid monitoring and control, data storage and analysis, among others. To make this possible, the Smart Grid requires a two-way wide area communications network between different dispersed areas, from generation, to distribution to consumer premises. In fact, it will consist of many different types of communications networks such as wide area networks, local area network, home area networks, etc. This requires a new architectural approach to implement a common communications infrastructure that provides the reliability, scalability, security and interoperability to support multiple applications. In addition, open standards addressing interoperability, are key for the development and deployment of the Smart Grid as a true integrated network. A communications backbone is necessary to provide interoperability. To achieve the level of networking, interoperability and security that meets the technical requirements of the Smart Grid, its data communications network architecture must be built using standard, open protocols. Internet Protocol (IP) and broadband networks could form the backbone of this infrastructure, as they are flexible and resilient enough to meet the demand of the grid. The Benefits of using IP-based networks include the maturity of a large number of IP standards, the availability of tools and applications that can be applied to multiple smart grid areas, and the widespread use of IP technologies in both private and public networks. In addition, IP technologies are the link between applications and the underlying communication physical medium. They allow applications to be developed independent of both the communications infrastructure and the various communications technologies to be used, either wired or wireless. From a general point of view, the main role of communication and networking technologies is to make the current electrical grid, smart. The Smart Grid will use many types of communications technologies such as public and private, wired and wireless, licensed and unlicensed, and standard and proprietary technologies. There exist a great number of communications and networking technologies that can be used to support smart grid applications, including fiber opticssystems, cellular, satellite, trunked radio, WiMAX, power line carrier, broadband over power lines (BPL), and IP, as well as in-home technologies such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, HomePlug, ZigBee, RF Mesh, etc. In this work, an analysis of the most relevant communications and networking technologies applicable to the Smart Grid is presented.},

	abstract = {Unit commitment (UC) in industrial microgrids (IMGs) is an important issue which has not received much attention in the literature. IMGs consist of many factories with distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric loads that heavily rely on combined heat and power systems. This study illustrates that UC in an IMG is not solely a profit-based UC or a security constrained UC (SCUC) problem. Therefore a new profit-based SCUC (PB-SCUC) formulation is proposed for IMGs that includes both microgrid (MG) security and factories constraints while utilising the generators waste heat to fulfill thermal requirements. The MG controller will solve the PB-SCUC problem to minimise the final production cost through maximisation of the profit by selling electricity to the upstream network. As each DER and boiler may have an individual owner, an approach based on game theory is also implemented to fairly allocate cost saving among factories participating in the generation process. Detailed simulation results are presented for an IMG consisting of 12 factories and analysed to show the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2013.},

	abstract = {Smart Grid (SG) and Microgrid (MG) concepts have been widely developed and discussed in literature in the last decade. Nevertheless, real performances and constraints for the practical application of smart technologies in deregulated electrical market, as well as the impact of penetration into grid and distribution systems, are still vague. On one hand, a MG appears as the perfect demand's side interface of SG, capable to integrate the goals of both sides, as enhancing internal and external reliability, reducing peak demand, shifting consumption to off-peak hours, lowering total energy, supporting the grid by renewable resources, etc. On the other hand, many difficulties arise from the remarkable difference between planning and operational control of MGs, based on dispersed and intermittent resources, and the conventional method of planning or operation of systems based on electricity production in centralized power generation station and delivery through passive distribution network to end-users. For this reason, some further contributions to both systematization and focusing the work to be still done for the implementation of MGs paradigms seem to be necessary to faster step forward the future MG's power market. This paper aims to give a contribution to the systematization of a model of intelligent electrical power system, directing the research to the evolution of power system towards solutions that can be comprehensive of SG concepts.The generalized configuration considered in this paper arises from the numerous proposals of MG's objectives and features, with respect to which a new comprehensive approach aimed at integrating the more recent platforms built on the concepts of Multi-Microgrid (MMG), Multi-Agent System (MAS) and Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is described, with a procedure of customization which tends to systematize the path from MG to SG, also considering the case in which the SG can dialogue with MGs by multiple interfaces. A comprehensive discussion on the advantages of implementing this approach is provided and a simple application is performed in order to demonstrate the usefulness of considering a multiple interface SG real case. Such suggestions could help to enlarge energy management opportunities as well as major participation in market for elecricity users interested to get into the world of renewable energy resouces and SGs.},

Each microgrid is up to 250 × 250 μm2 with a height of 60 μm. Overlayed cells settle into the grids and the walls restrict their lateral movement, but a contiguous supply of medium between neighboring microgrids facilitates the exchange of cytokines and growth factors. This allows culture over at least 6 days with no impact upon viability and proliferation.

This paper proposes a new utility computer network security authentication of requests for actions / commands in the smart-grid operations. The authentication covers multiple security domains in a new security architecture designed for smart power grids.

	abstract = {Although it has slowed considerably, consumption of electricity continues to grow in developed economies. Further, there are some unknowns which might accelerate this growth, such as electrification of vehicle fleets and geothermal heat pump space and water heating. Most analysts anticipate that distributed energy resources (DER) will provide a large share of the expanded generation capacity required to meet this seemingly inexorably increasing electricity demand. Further, given the urgency of tackling the climate change problem, most of the added assets must be carbon-free renewables or nuclear, end-use efficiency improvements, or highly efficient fossil-fired technologies. In developed economies worldwide, the current power delivery paradigm has been in place for more than a century, i.e. since the emergence of polyphase AC systems around the turn of the last century. A key feature of this structure is that, in principle, universal service is delivered at a consistent level of power quality and reliability (PQR) throughout large regions. This paper describes a future possible structure for the electricity generation and delivery system that leaves the existing high voltage meshed grid paradigm in place, but involves radical reorganization of parts of the distribution network and customer sites. Managing a much more diverse dispersed system poses major challenges to the current centralized grid paradigm, particularly since many of these assets are small to tiny by macrogrid standards and they may ultimately number in the millions. They are also not ones that centralized control can rely upon to function in traditionally dependable ways, e.g. renewable generation can be highly variable and changes in output of generators are not independent. Although most involved in the industry agree that a paradigm shift is both necessary and desirable to manage the new system, the nature of the future system remains quite unclear. In the possible structure described here, the traditional grid, or macrogrid, remains similar at the high voltage meshed level. Three new entities are added more locally: community grids or milligrids that operate a segment of the existing distribution system, microgrids which are akin to current customer sites but which have automonous control, and nanogrids, such as telecom or Ethernet networks that currently distribute power to many low-power devices. The latter exist currently in the local electrical systems but are not typically considered a part of the traditional electricity supply system. Because all these new entities exhibit some localized control, providing appropriate local heterogeneous PQR becomes a possibility. These new grid concepts enable a more "bottom-up" approach to electricity distribution, in contrast to the historic "top-down" model. The future will almost certainly include a mix of the two, but the balance among them and the interface (if any) between them is unclear.},

	abstract = {Growth in IT infrastructure driven by socio-economic demand for services has led to the creation of large data centers. There is a need for cost-effective and sustainable design and management of such data centers. From this perspective, evolutionary changes in the regulatory and operational climate of traditional electrical and energy utilities has created new opportunities for development of data centers with low TCO and environmental footprint. These opportunities primarily exist on developing unique supply-side architectures for delivery of power, water and other resources to service data centers. Concurrent emergence of smaller heat and power generating systems also provides novel options to create solutions that improve the reliability and scalability of supply-side infrastructures in data centers. In this paper we investigate the impact of combined heat and power generation in operation of data centers in reducing TCO and environmental footprint and improving operational reliability. Usage of natural resources like water, fuel is minimized to create a low footprint IT infrastructure. Through use of mix of on-site power generation technologies alongside energy and water storage we create a power, cooling and water microgrid for the data center. Such microgrids are a promising way to capture the significant potential of smaller distributed energy resources to meet growing demands for low footprint IT infrastructures.

	abstract = {In the time of rapid changes in power industry the need to develop new power systems arises. The newly developed systems should aim at wide utilisation of renewable power sources and CO2-neutral technologies. This goal can be achieved by e.g. dissipated generation, or integrating DG into microgrids. The microgrids can be built using AC or DC current networks. Authors propose DC microgrid as a new idea for a small, balanced distribution power system. It has been designed to supply small towns and villages with electricity with high penetration of renewable energy resources. However, designing an optimal microgrid is not an easy task, due to the fact that primary energy carriers are changeable and uncontrollable, as is the demand. Traditional design and optimisation tools, developed for controlled power sources, cannot be employed here. Simulation methods seem to be the best solution. The microgrid consists of several devices, with most important among them - the power electronic devices. Schematic simulation tools, like PSpice, PSIM or TCad, are usually used for power electronic converters simulation. However the above mentioned simulation method is slow and does not allow modeling the microgrid's network. Therefore new models of converters have been developed. The authors employed Simulink to simulate power flow and static voltage behaviour in the microgrid. The models developed on the example of half bridge converter are presented in the paper, as is the comparison of PSIM and authors' models. The conclusion from the research is that new static and power flow models are interesting solutions for designing small power system simulation like the DC microgrid. ©2009 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The increasing environmental concerns about energy activities move power systems towards a new scenario, where dispersed generation and conventional one coexist: the former close to the consumption, possibly in microgrids, the latter in bulk installations far from the consumption. Future systems will be characterized by better performing grids, able to compensate for geographical and temporal fluctuation of generation and loads by interconnecting local power systems and wheeling large generation. Load side too will contribute to the change, thanks to emerging possibilities offered to consumers (next prosumers) to participate into the electricity markets with an increased flexibility of their demand. In the new scenario, power systems are faced with many challenges, in terms of both technical and non-technical issues. At the same time, new business opportunities will arise, together with improved energy efficiency and better usage of primary sources. Investments in new local generating facilities embedded in microgrids may offer good chances of profitable economic returns as well as a more environment-friendly energy usage. In this scope, small and micro cogeneration systems based on fuel cells may be convenient. Fuel cells are electrochemical devices that convert chemical energy into electricity and heat, through reactions between a fuel and an oxidant triggered in the presence of an electrolyte. Fuel cell systems are available to meet the requirements of applications ranging from portable electronics to power plants. In addition to the fuel cell stack itself, a fuel cell system includes a fuel processor and subsystems to manage air, water, heat and electricity. The overall system is efficient at full and partload, widely scalable, environmentally friendly, and potentially competitive with conventional technologies. Recently, in a RTD project at our University a micro-cogeneration unit based on fuel cells has been studied, developed and prototyped for dispersed applications, where the fuel is obtained by reforming natural gas. The size is such that it may be used in residential units and small commercial installations to supply both heat and electricity. If electrical distribution supply is available, electric surplus/deficit of energy is sold/bought; otherwise, as during network outages, micro-cogeneration system can work in islanded mode, with the duty of satisfying its own loads. Multiple micro-cogeneration units can be connected on the electrical side to work together (assumed it is allowed by local grid code), thus gaining in flexibility of operation; in this case a central control is needed to manage the couplings and the opportunities of the resulting multi-site system. The paper illustrates the control system functions and actions needed to guarantee the correct and economic operation of a multi-site micro-cogeneration installation based on fuel-cells. Both cases of synchronous and islanded operation are discussed. A mathematical model of the optimal operation in synchronous mode is presented. The results obtained on the test system show the characteristics of the proposed solution.},

	abstract = {Introduction of new technologies is necessarily a social and cultural transformation that implies adaptation to a new context, co-created by the interaction between those intervened and interveners. Sustainable technologies should be aimed to preserve basic functions of socio-ecological systems while limiting evolution of unsustainable practices, as it is the case of non-conventional renewable energy sources.In this research we propose a methodology of intervention for the introduction of smart microgrid system in a rural community. The introduction of new energy technologies in a rural setting is a challenge, since it generates changes in patters of energy use that affect the demand of the system. Smart microgrid systems have the advantage of being more resilient than conventional approaches to renewable energy, as they can adapt to changes in the demand and through time.The proposed methodology is based on the concept of a community as a socio-ecological system approach affected by a technological intervention, aimed to move towards a stage of more sustainable use of resources. The method is divided in three stages, each one focused on enhancing elements of the socio-ecological systems and integration among stakeholders: trust, diversity, boundaries of the system, territoriality, adaptability and reflexivity.This methodology is validated in a case study on smart microgrids development in a rural community in the north of Chile. The application of this methodology highlights the importance of learning processes among stakeholders, specially the development of reflexivity within developers.Adoption and adaptation to new technologies depends on the characteristics of each community, but it can be enhanced when participation shapes the evolution of the technological intervention, opening up to a diversity of expectations associated to the complexity of the system. © 2011 International Energy Initiative.},

In this context, power system operators may take advantage of EVs equipped with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies to deal with network congestion management issues. The working framework is an electric power system where energy trading is organized through an auction where the agents can exchange energy within it or alternatively between neighbouring distribution networks. An approach is proposed to address V2G strategies for congestion management issues. Power distribution factors (DFs) are used to determine the amount of energy that a specific EV should contribute to alleviate the congestion in a line. It is assumed that EVs can decrease or increase their battery energy level, stop their charging or even inject energy to the grid aiming for the secure state of the system. This approach is tested for a reference microgrid (MG) example containing several EVs and it is shown to be suitable to solve this kind of technical problems. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The enabling of ac microgrids in distribution networks allows delivering distributed power and providing grid support services during regular operation of the grid, as well as powering isolated islands in case of faults and contingencies, thus increasing the performance and reliability of the electrical system. The high penetration of distributed generators, linked to the grid through highly controllable power processors based on power electronics, together with the incorporation of electrical energy storage systems, communication technologies, and controllable loads, opens new horizons to the effective expansion of microgrid applications integrated into electrical power systems. This paper carries out an overview about microgrid structures and control techniques at different hierarchical levels. At the power converter level, a detailed analysis of the main operation modes and control structures for power converters belonging to microgrids is carried out, focusing mainly on grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting configurations. This analysis is extended as well toward the hierarchical control scheme of microgrids, which, based on the primary, secondary, and tertiary control layer division, is devoted to minimize the operation cost, coordinating support services, meanwhile maximizing the reliability and the controllability of microgrids. Finally, the main grid services that microgrids can offer to the main network, as well as the future trends in the development of their operation and control for the next future, are presented and discussed. © 2012 IEEE.},

Given the characteristics of the LV networks, it is shown that traditional control strategies using only reactive power control may not be sufficient in order to perform efficient voltage control. Therefore, microgeneration shedding must also be employed, especially in scenarios with extreme microgeneration penetration. An optimisation tool based on a meta-heuristic approach was developed to address the voltage control problem. In addition, neural networks were employed in order to decrease computational time, thus enabling the use of the tool for online operation. The results obtained revealed good performance of this control approach. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, as set by the EU 20-20-20 targets, the reduction of primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector can be attained by increasing the use of renewable sources and improving energy efficiency. Many national and international research programs are aiming at developing innovative technologies and new energy management strategies in order to reach the targets set out in the 20-20-20 directive. In this context, a primary role is played by the Distributed Generation (DG), which refers to the electrical and thermal generation located near to the place of use, exploiting available renewable sources. One of the best way to exploit the emerging potential of DG is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a whole concept called microgrid. The sources can operate in parallel to the grid or can operate in island, providing utility power station services. Utilization of waste heat from the sources will increase total efficiency, making the polygeneration microgrid more financially attractive and smart from the energy consumption standpoint. The smartness is also in the management system, where control strategies aiming at the optimization of technical, economical and environmental issues are typically implemented. This paper deals with smart microgrids, addressing basically the following topics: (1) to review methods, models, tools, technologies and research challenges in the specific field; (2) to present the University of Genoa Smart Polygeneration Microgrid (SPM), built with the financial contribution of the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research at the decentralized Savona Campus facilities. The SPM produces energy at low emissions for the University and operates as a test-bed facility for research, testing and development of smart grid components. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper deals with the recent evolution of microgrids being used around the world in real life applications as well as laboratory application for research. This study is intended to introduce the subject by reviewing the components level, structure and types of microgrid applications installed as a plant or modeled as a simulation environment. The paper also presents a survey regarding published papers on why the microgrid is required, and what the components and control systems are which constitute the actual microgrid studies. It leads the researcher to see the microgrid in terms of the actual bigger picture of today and creates a new outlook about the potential developments. Additionally, comparison of microgrids in various regions based on several parameters allows researchers to define the required criteria and features of a special microgrid that is chosen for a particular scenario. The authors of this paper also tabulated all the necessary information about microgrids, and proposed a standard microgrid for better power quality and optimizing energy generation. Consequently, it is focused on inadequate knowledge and technology gaps in the power system field with regards to the future, and it is this which has been illustrated for the reader. The existing microgrid testbeds all around the world have been studied and analyzed and several of them are explained as an example in this study. Later, those investigated distribution systems are classified based on region (North America, Europe and Asia) and, as presented in literature, a significant amount of deviation has been found. Several tabulated data sheets have been used to compare and contrast the existing test systems. This research has been concluded with worthy findings and potential areas of research that would enhance the current distributed network as well as introduce microgrid testbeds comprehensively, and aid designers in optimizing green distributed system efficiency for a reliable power supply. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {As policy makers seek to integrate a serious sociological and environmental issue into energy production, the typical utility is faced with not only technology upgrades, but also dealing with new systemic events that occur far beyond its franchise borders. Adding renewable energy resources into the existing bulk generation power system can be accomplished through a smarter power grid when the integration includes complex, end-to-end control strategies and consumer incentives to participate. Application of renewable resources will provide environmentally clean, and eventually, cost effective energy alternatives to the existing mix of electric generation assets. An even more interesting consideration is that integrating distributed energy resources (DER) will likely become the normal state, as siting transmission becomes more challenging. DER requires addressing facets of both the underlying analog-centric electrical power system and the nascent digital-centric information infrastructure. As smart grid develops, integration and optimization of grid control logic are areas that stand as key enablers to a rapid growth of renewable generation. This paper presents a serious discussion of the impact significant renewable energy generation can wage against the existing power system and how sophisticated smart grid control elements can address its integration into distributed energy systems. Technology addressing these concepts is under development now by General MicroGrids' Microgrid research and development program in San Diego California. © 2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems in island microgrids (MGs) are becoming increasingly attractive as a means of energy generation, due to new developments in technologies, environmental concerns, and transmission congestion management. Usually, the energy storage system (ESS) is used to store the excess power generated during off-peak hours, and to return it to the system when power from PV is not enough for the system, or generation is more expensive. A real-time dynamic programming algorithm for energy storage in a PV/battery system, based on the battery charge and discharge characteristics, and current and temperature dependence of the capacity of the battery, is presented in this paper. The work aims to extend existing battery- aware programming techniques. It differs from previous works, as it takes into consideration many aspects of battery characteristics that were not considered previously. This allows better use of the battery bank and can prolong the battery service time. This paper also builds a simple PV/battery system in an island microgrid. In this paper, fuel cell power plants (FCPPs) are permanently used to operate in island microgrids, and 2 batteries are used as reserves for charge and discharge in various hours. © 2015, Walailak J Sci & Tech.

MicroGrids can be connected to the main power network or be operated autonomously, similar to power systems of physical islands. The local DG units besides selling energy to the network have also other tasks: producing heat for local installations, keeping the voltage locally at a certain level or providing a backup system for local critical loads in case of a failure of the main system.

	abstract = {Environmentally friendly renewable energy technologies such as photovoltaics and clean, efficient, fossil-fuels technologies such as micro-turbines and fuel cells are among new generating systems driving the demand for distributed generation of electricity. If combined heat and power at residential industrial plants or commercial buildings can be achieved the efficiencies can be higher than conventional central generation plants. The smallness of these new distributed generation along with the low voltages at the interface create a new class of problems which requires innovative approaches to managing and operating the distributed resources. One such concept is the microgrid. © 2001 IEEE.},

A packaged system is developed by the DTE Energy Technology Inc., in which a turbine will handle base loads while a reciprocating engine handles the variable load. By combining reciprocating engines and turbines with microgrids, the gas turbines can be used to provide base-load power and high thermal output for heating or air-conditioning. The microgrids are designed to provide better power quality than the grid, because they operate independently of the grid.},

	abstract = {According to a recent Shell study, renewable energies will increase in use in the coming 50 years. By 2050 renewable energies will cover more than half of global energy needs. The EC also bets on this card. Already by 2010 renewable energies are expected to contribute 22% of generated electricity. In this huge market ABB wants to increase its engagement. After the sale of company activities in large power plant construction, ABB directs its engineering to the comprehensive concept of decentralized energy generation. ABB has developed a revolutionary concept for wind power facilities that operate without gears and transformers with a 20% greater power output. Maintenance expenses are also halved Two hundred thirty patents cover this "Windformer" development.. With these premises ABB promises complete cost effectiveness. Using this technology even small facilities are only (US)4¢/kw-hr more expensive than fossil fuel generators. Wind energy is flanked by other techniques. Microturbines fueled with natural gas for 300-500 kw output use the principle of power-heat-coupling and are usable by residences, hospitals, and industry. By 2005 ABB jointly with Volvo Aero Corp of Trollhättan, Sweden, will have sold 40,000 units. ABB and DuPont will jointly develop fuel cells. The goal is to make fuel cells available to users with natural gas connections to generate electricity more cost effectively by themselves than by buying electricity from utility companies. ABB has the vision of new, small, and decentralized electricity grids or "microgrids". By this is understood the bundling of a group of electricity generators with one another using control and guidance technology. The typical microgrid would amount to 10 Mw, enough to supply 5,000-7,000 inhabitants. The electricity and heat would come from a mix of power-and-heat power plants, wind and micro turbines, and fuel and solar cells. Such models have many advantages. The investment, maintenance, and operating costs are low and the renewable energy sources have a large share in the mix with correspondingly positive effects on the environment. By 2005 ABB wants to have a turnover in this total field of a billion US dollars. Worldwide there are about 1.2 billion households of which about 750 million have no access to electricity. For most of them, decentralized electricity is the ideal, the only solution. Diagram.},
